<div>
<p>Our <strong>1.5LTE Low Thermal Expansion Length Reference Bar</strong> provides a stable length artifact for use during laser tracker, articulating arm or scanner jobs. Its unique design minimizes length changes in the bar due to thermal growth. This provides a virtually constant length through a wide working temperature range. Testing has shown that the 1.5LTE has a thermal stability <strong>40% better than Invar.</strong></p>
<p>Integrated target holders on each end are positioned off-axis and allow the SMR to rotate 360° for easy visibility. A new 3-point mount constrains the bar in the field exactly as it is certified at the factory to assure the highest accuracy possible. Set the bar anywhere in your measurement volume to confirm instrument accuracy or add reference points to your network*.</p>
<p>The 1.5LTE consists of a single length of invar tubing with two permanently mounted aluminum end caps, each with a 1.5"" magnetic SMR nest (SMRs not included). Switching SMR sizes during a measurement session is easy with a <a href=""/metrology-3d-measurement-smr-target-holders-1-5-adp-to-0-5-smr-adapter-converter.html"">1.5ADP-.5</a> or <a href=""/1-5adp-875-smr-adapter.html"">1.5ADP-.875 </a>adapter to locate 0.5"" or 0.875"" SMRs at exactly the same point as a 1.5"" SMR.</p>
<p>This item is available in a 1 meter length (target center to target center), where the reference bar's actual length is within ±1.5 mm (±0.06"") of 1 meter. The LTE bar is certified with a NIST traceable measurement that includes an expanded uncertainty of ±0.007 mm at a 95% confidence interval. <a href=""https://patents.google.com/patent/US8141264"" target=""_blank"">Patent No. US 8,141,264</a>.</p>

<p>The LTE bar maintains a very low coefficient of expansion by virtue of its unique design. Invar, already a very thermally stable material, is used as the main component. Aluminum end caps are permanently mounted to the ends of the invar bar, with an SMR target nest situated inboard from the end of the bar. When the bar lengthens and moves the target nests further apart, the end caps also expand, moving the target nests back together again. The nest locations are precisely calculated to effectively cancel out the length change in the assembly. </p>

<div>
<p>The <strong>1.5THF</strong> floor target mount provides for a permanent target location in the floor or wall. Following initial installation, it may be surveyed for its final position. This gives you the ability to quickly re-establish coordinate systems in the future by providing known, permanent reference points. They may also be used without an initial survey to provide permanent coordinate system transfer points. Or use them to monitor the movement of foundations over time by checking for deviation from originally mapped coordinates.</p>
<p>The 1.5THF is meant to be grouted or epoxied permanently into holes which have been drilled in concrete floors or walls, so that the top is flush with the surface of the floor or wall. An aggressive knurl around the circumference as well as a large concave groove give this target mount lots of holding power in the surrounding grout. The cap has an O-ring seal to keep the target mount surfaces out of danger and free of debris. The 1.5THF assembly may be attached to a customer-provided positioning jig while being grouting in place, via the M6 threaded hole on top of the lid. In this way, the 1.5THF can be easily positioned so that the top is flush with the floor. A flat or straight-bladed screw driver allows easy removal of the lid.</p>

<div>The <strong>1.5THMF </strong>adapter is designed to work with the THMF mini floor-mount base, giving you a permanent target location in the floor or wall. Following initial installation of the THMF base unit, this adapter may be installed and surveyed for its actual coordinates using a 1.5"" SMR. The adapter may be removed and reinstalled in the base, maintaining target position tolerance. Therefore you can quickly re-establish coordinate systems in the future by providing known, permanent reference points. This system may also be used without an initial survey to provide permanent coordinate system transfer points. Or, use them to monitor the movement of foundations or other features over time by checking for deviation from originally mapped coordinates.

The adapter also has two blind holes which fit a 15130 spanner (purchased separately), if you need a little extra torque to remove it. The 1/4"" shank with internal 6-32 tapped hole mates securely with the base unit, positively locking the adapter in place.

<h2>The tall one!</h2>
<div class=""tabs"" id=""content-container"">
</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"" style=""text-align: justify;"">Our <strong>232 Series </strong>stands are great for those special jobs where reaching the heights is required. The 232 is available in a number of configurations, whose working heights range from a minimum of <strong><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">67"" (1.7 m)</span></strong> to as high as <span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>112"" (2.84 m)</strong></span>, depending upon the configuration desired. Stand height is measured from the floor to the top of the intermediate tube, on which all instrument mount accessories are attached. This height specification does not include the added height and range any of our stand accessories or instrument adapters.
<p>A wide variety of our stand adapters, slides, lifts, and various instrument mounts fit into the intermediate tube, which is outfitted with the same 2.825""-20 thread as the intermediate tube on our other, shorter stands. </p>
<p>The 232 Series is also available in a ""hollow"" version, which means that there is an unobstructed vertical path straight down through the center of the stand. This is useful in certain applications when it is critical to position the stand over a specific point. Any stand or accessory designated as ""hollow"" has this characteristic.</p>
<p>Stands in this group are used to support all types of metrology instrumentation, and customers who use this stand need stability in high places. Mobility around the shop floor is permitted using the drop-down casters under the heavy-duty tribrach base which are engaged and released by a handwheel crank mechanism. An air-check mechanism provides backup protection to prevent sudden drops of the instrument column in case the operator simultaneously releases the collar lock and main handle while disengaging the ratchet pawl.</p>
<p>For general information about this stand, you can read more <a href=""http://brunson.us/metrology-optical-measurement-products-alignment-about-our-products/about-stands-heavy-duty/"">about our heavy duty stands</a> on this website.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: If these stands are not tall enough for you, check out the <a title=""232-SP Series Wide Height Range (Very Tall)"" href=""http://brunson.us/shop/metrology-3d-measurement-adjustable-height-stands-for-metrology-232-sp-series-very-tall/"">232-SP Series</a> stands, or contact us for a custom stand quote.

<p>The <strong>234 Series</strong> of stand extensions increase the effective stand height from 3"" (7.6 cm) to 48"" (122 cm), depending upon model (see table below). Although these tubes are not designed to provide a precision height standard, metric extension tubes are also available as a complement to an all-metric system. Made of your choice of heavy-walled steel or aluminum tubing with a standard 3½""-8 thread on each end (one internal on the bottom to fit the stand, and one external on the top to fit an instrument or adapter). Other lengths and thread specifications are available by special order.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Extension tubes are provided to increase versatility of measurement systems. Excessive stand height build-up using extension tubes is not recommended due to the possibility of decreased stability and accuracy.</p>

<div class=""tabs"" id=""content-container"">

<p>The <strong>234 Series</strong> of stand extensions increase the effective stand height from 3"" (7.6 cm) to 48"" (122 cm), depending upon model (see table below). Although these tubes are not designed to provide a precision height standard, metric extension tubes are also available as a complement to an all-metric system. Made of your choice of heavy-walled steel or aluminum tubing with a standard 3½""-8 thread on each end (one internal on the bottom to fit the stand, and one external on the top to fit an instrument or adapter). Other lengths and thread specifications are available by special order.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Extension tubes are provided to increase versatility of measurement systems. Excessive stand height build-up using extension tubes is not recommended due to the possibility of decreased stability and accuracy.</p>

<div class=""tabs"" id=""content-container"">

<p>The <strong>234 Series</strong> of stand extensions increase the effective stand height from 3"" (7.6 cm) to 48"" (122 cm), depending upon model (see table below). Although these tubes are not designed to provide a precision height standard, metric extension tubes are also available as a complement to an all-metric system. Made of your choice of heavy-walled steel or aluminum tubing with a standard 3½""-8 thread on each end (one internal on the bottom to fit the stand, and one external on the top to fit an instrument or adapter). Other lengths and thread specifications are available by special order.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Extension tubes are provided to increase versatility of measurement systems. Excessive stand height build-up using extension tubes is not recommended due to the possibility of decreased stability and accuracy.</p>

<div class=""tabs"" id=""content-container"">

<p>The <strong>234 Series</strong> of stand extensions increase the effective stand height from 3"" (7.6 cm) to 48"" (122 cm), depending upon model (see table below). Although these tubes are not designed to provide a precision height standard, metric extension tubes are also available as a complement to an all-metric system. Made of your choice of heavy-walled steel or aluminum tubing with a standard 3½""-8 thread on each end (one internal on the bottom to fit the stand, and one external on the top to fit an instrument or adapter). Other lengths and thread specifications are available by special order.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Extension tubes are provided to increase versatility of measurement systems. Excessive stand height build-up using extension tubes is not recommended due to the possibility of decreased stability and accuracy.</p>

<div>
<div id=""copy"" class=""tab"">The <strong>239 Series</strong> consists of pedestal stands which are similar to our popular heavy-duty mobile stands except that they do not have an intermediate tube which may be raised or lowered. Other than the adjustment provided by any adapters which are mounted on the stand, the height is fixed. The 239 is available in several configurations. The standard height of this stand is <strong><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">40 5/8"" (103 cm)</span></strong>, as measured from the floor to the top of the main outer tube, on top of which all instrument mount accessories are attached. However, the stand may be ordered at any custom height specification.&nbsp;<br />
<p>A variety of stand adapters, slides, lifts, and various instrument mounts fit into the intermediate tube.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The baseplate is a 1"" (2.54 cm) thick steel plate with a diameter of 15"" (38.1 cm). Four 1-1/16"" (2.7 cm) mounting holes are equally spaced on an 11"" (27.9 cm) diameter bolt circle on this baseplate. It is also outfitted with four 5/8""-11 UNC-2B threaded leveling screws on a 14"" (35.6 cm) diameter bolt circle to provide a means for adjustment to set the stand vertical.</p>
<p>Stands in this group are used for permanent installations of all types of metrology instrumentation, and are often used in test, calibration, or constant monitoring applications.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>When customers asked Brunson to engineer a lightweight industrial stand, they turned to one of the strongest structural elements known €“ a pre-stressed tetrahedron for ultimate stability. Made from aluminum and stainless steel, the TetraLock and the TetraLock Lite include pad feet, a choice of thread adapter, and a duffel style carrying bag. These portable stands can be checked in as luggage or stowed in the trunk, and used on tables or platforms.</p>
<p>Engineered for extreme stability, the lightweight TetraLock stand weighs just over 20 lbs. with a maximum height of 47 inches. Due to the TetraLock's unique design, no joint movement is possible when locked in the open position. The TetraLock Lite featherweight stand weighs in at 16.2 lbs. also with a maximum height of 47 inches. It deploys rapidly by tightening a locking plate under its mounting ring.</p>
<p>Both designs offer the best price/performance ratio in the marketplace.</p>

<p>The height of the stand is adjusted by releasing quick-action levers and setting each telescoping leg to the desired length. Index marks on the legs provide visual guides when doing this. Each leg is outfitted with a ""pad style"" foot. The TetraLock may be purchased with one of three thread mounts: 3½""-8, 5/8""-11, or 3/8""-16. A duffel style canvas carrying bag with shoulder strap is also included with the stand.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>When customers asked Brunson to engineer a lightweight industrial stand, they turned to one of the strongest structural elements known €“ a pre-stressed tetrahedron for ultimate stability. Made from aluminum and stainless steel, the TetraLock and the TetraLock Lite include pad feet, a choice of thread adapter, and a duffel style carrying bag. These portable stands can be checked in as luggage or stowed in the trunk, and used on tables or platforms.</p>
<p>Engineered for extreme stability, the lightweight TetraLock stand weighs just over 20 lbs. with a maximum height of 47 inches. Due to the TetraLock's unique design, no joint movement is possible when locked in the open position. The TetraLock Lite featherweight stand weighs in at 16.2 lbs. also with a maximum height of 47 inches. It deploys rapidly by tightening a locking plate under its mounting ring.</p>
<p>Both designs offer the best price/performance ratio in the marketplace.</p>

<p>The height of the stand is adjusted by releasing quick-action levers and setting each telescoping leg to the desired length. Index marks on the legs provide visual guides when doing this. Each leg is outfitted with a ""pad style"" foot. The TetraLock may be purchased with one of three thread mounts: 3½""-8, 5/8""-11, or 3/8""-16. A duffel style canvas carrying bag with shoulder strap is also included with the stand.</p>

<h2>Metric unit kits for a variety of uses</h2>
<div class=""tabs"" id=""content-container"">
</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"" style=""text-align: justify;"">The <strong>803-M</strong> and <strong>803-MC Invar Kits </strong>are designed as multipurpose kits. They are often used as scale extension tools - precisely extending the range of standard optical tooling scales for accurate measurement of larger dimensions, or to access previously unreachable points. They are also used with calibration scales such as our <a title=""6000-CE and 6000-CM Calibration Targets"" href=""http://brunson.us/product/metrology-3d-measurement-calibration-scales-6000-ce-6000-cm/"">6000-CM </a>(and others) as calibration or scaling artifacts for three dimensional measurement systems.
<p><a href=""http://brunson.us/metrology-optical-measurement-products-alignment-about-our-products/about-invar/"">Invar tubing is great for metrology</a> because it has such a very low coefficient of thermal expansion. which effectively eliminates changes in length due to handling or environmental changes. This is particularly beneficial when measuring a system in its ""hot"" or running state.</p>
</div>
<div class=""tab"" id=""copy"" style=""text-align: justify;""><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-2467"" title=""803-M series metric invar kits"" alt="""" src=""{{store url=""""}}wp-content/uploads/2013/03/803-M-series.gif"" width=""403"" height=""90"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The 803-M and 803-MC kits both contain exactly the same set of components; the only difference between them is that the Invar tubing is manufactured to different length tolerances. The Invar tubing in the 803-M is manufactured to its stated length within +-0.008 mm, and the Invar tubing in the 803-MC is manufactured to its stated length within +-0.003 mm. Our metric Invar tubing covered with a tough polyvinyl layer designed to protect your tubing and to allow for easy cleaning. Our metric tubing is yellow in color (English tubing is red).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In each kit, the Invar tubing components are hand-picked so that the total Invar tube stackup error does not exceed the stated maximum. This means that you can connect all of the tubes found in a given kit together end-to-end, and the stack will maintain the total length within the stackup error. (The table above right summarizes this information.)</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Individual components may be assembled to produce lengths from 25 mm to 2800 mm, in 125 mm increments. The end of each invar tube allows measuring to the tangents of shafts, and a tooling ball contact point offers the best repeatability on most machine surfaces. The table below specifies all included components.

<p>The <strong>BP</strong> Series Bar Points are used in conjunction with our BXT Series extension bars and various SMR holders having 1/4"" or 6mm shafts. This type of assembly (see photo at bottom of page) is often used to locate and specify various points using a sphere-fit routine*. The BP is handy for targeting scribe lines, edges, or other points of interest on surfaces or contours. It is especially useful for measuring points which are obscured from view. Using the BP with its targeting assembly to measure hidden points allows you to avoid making additional tracker moves and subsequent rebundles, thereby saving time and potential error buildup. These adapters make more efficient use of your laser tracker equipment while maintaining the accuracy needed for most tasks.</p>
<p>The BP includes a 6-32 set screw at the bottom of the hole (see sketch below). This is used to secure the BP to our BXT extension bars. Be sure to match the BP unit type with BXT unit type (English or metric).</p>

<p>*A ""sphere fit rod"" assembly (shown right) may be constructed from a BXT extension bar, an SMR adapter, and a BP Bar Point. It is used to measure a number of points which are all a given distance away from one particular point of interest, making that point of interest the center of an arbitrary sphere. Then, a sphere-fit routine is commonly used to calculate that center point. In the picture, the BP is centered on a scribe line.</p>

<p>The <strong>BP</strong> Series Bar Points are used in conjunction with our BXT Series extension bars and various SMR holders having 1/4"" or 6mm shafts. This type of assembly (see photo at bottom of page) is often used to locate and specify various points using a sphere-fit routine*. The BP is handy for targeting scribe lines, edges, or other points of interest on surfaces or contours. It is especially useful for measuring points which are obscured from view. Using the BP with its targeting assembly to measure hidden points allows you to avoid making additional tracker moves and subsequent rebundles, thereby saving time and potential error buildup. These adapters make more efficient use of your laser tracker equipment while maintaining the accuracy needed for most tasks.</p>
<p>The BP includes a 6-32 set screw at the bottom of the hole (see sketch below). This is used to secure the BP to our BXT extension bars. Be sure to match the BP unit type with BXT unit type (English or metric).</p>

<p>*A ""sphere fit rod"" assembly (shown right) may be constructed from a BXT extension bar, an SMR adapter, and a BP Bar Point. It is used to measure a number of points which are all a given distance away from one particular point of interest, making that point of interest the center of an arbitrary sphere. Then, a sphere-fit routine is commonly used to calculate that center point. In the picture, the BP is centered on a scribe line.</p>

<p>The <strong>M-Series </strong> metrology stands have been requested both by customers and other metrology instrument OEMs. With their input, Brunson has designed this instrument stand for functionality and portability. This collapsible, tripod-type stand is available in a number of standard configurations. Just tell us your preference.</p>
<p><strong>Graphite or aluminum legs.</strong> These stands are available with aluminum or graphite double upper legs, which span from the shoulder pivots to the ""knee"" of the stand. Stands with graphite upper legs have a lower weight and give an advantage with respect to thermal stability.</p>
<p><strong>Adjustable or fixed instrument mount.</strong> The stand is available with either an adjustable instrument column, also called the ""intermediate tube"" (below left) or with an instrument adapter fixed directly to the tribrach at the top of the stand (below right). The adjustable instrument mount employs a handwheel-driven worm gear for up-and-down adjustment of the instrument column. The collar may then be clamped to avoid any inadvertent instrument movement. An adapter on top of the intermediate tube provides a standard external 3½""-8 thread for mounting instruments or other adapters. Note that the intermediate tubes on our M-Series portable stands do not have the same internal threads as found on our bigger stands, and as such will not directly accommodate adapters such as the model 800 precision lift.</p>

<p>The ""fixed height"" version of the stand has an adapter mounted directly to the top of the stand. For applications where fine vertical adjustment of the instrument is not necessary, this version reduces cost and increases lateral stability.</p>

<p>The <strong>M-Series </strong> metrology stands have been requested both by customers and other metrology instrument OEMs. With their input, Brunson has designed this instrument stand for functionality and portability. This collapsible, tripod-type stand is available in a number of standard configurations. Just tell us your preference.</p>
<p><strong>Graphite or aluminum legs.</strong> These stands are available with aluminum or graphite double upper legs, which span from the shoulder pivots to the ""knee"" of the stand. Stands with graphite upper legs have a lower weight and give an advantage with respect to thermal stability.</p>
<p><strong>Adjustable or fixed instrument mount.</strong> The stand is available with either an adjustable instrument column, also called the ""intermediate tube"" (below left) or with an instrument adapter fixed directly to the tribrach at the top of the stand (below right). The adjustable instrument mount employs a handwheel-driven worm gear for up-and-down adjustment of the instrument column. The collar may then be clamped to avoid any inadvertent instrument movement. An adapter on top of the intermediate tube provides a standard external 3½""-8 thread for mounting instruments or other adapters. Note that the intermediate tubes on our M-Series portable stands do not have the same internal threads as found on our bigger stands, and as such will not directly accommodate adapters such as the model 800 precision lift.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3817"" alt=""M-Series portable stands"" src=""{{store url=""""}}wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MGSAdj+Fixed1-300x204.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""204""></img></p>
<p>The ""fixed height"" version of the stand has an adapter mounted directly to the top of the stand. For applications where fine vertical adjustment of the instrument is not necessary, this version reduces cost and increases lateral stability.</p>
<p>Note that the height of either type of stand (fixed or adjustable mount) may be adjusted by extending and locking the lower legs at the desired position.</p>

<div><strong><br>Short or tall.</br></strong><span> The M-series stands are available in a short or tall version. The double upper leg section and the adjustable instrument column of the tall version are longer, providing the additional height. The lower leg sections are the same length on both versions.</span>
<p><strong>Points or pads.</strong> The stand's lower leg will accommodate two different types of feet €“ trivet points (image left top) or swivel pad feet (image left bottom). The swivel pads have a thin, textured rubber pad on the bottom. Either type of foot is an acceptable choice for general applications. The points work well on uneven surfaces, the pads work well on smooth surfaces (e.g., finished concrete) to resist sliding and soft surfaces (e.g., linoleum) which the points may damage. Pads have the additional advantage of being outfitted with a hole for semi-permanent mounting. The feet are easily interchangeable in the field. The M-Series comes standard with both trivet point feet and pad feet.</p>

<div class=""tabs"">
</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"">The <strong>THMF </strong>is a flexible solution for installing permanent reference target mounts in your facility's floors or walls. Small in size, it provides a secure base which can hold either 1.5"" or 0.5"" SMR target adapters. The THMF's knurled circumference and concave grooves give extra gripping power for gluing into place with epoxy or other grouting adhesives. The cap is outfitted with a straight blade screwdriver slot as well as an O-ring to seal out debris when not in use. The base of the THMF has a 6-32 machine screw located axially in the center of the bottom which is used to secure the cap as well as the target adapters.
<p>The THMF provides several advantages over other floor mount adapters. It is only 1"" tall and 0.75"" in diameter. It provides a mounting base for the 1.5THMF target adapter (for a 1.5"" SMR), or the 0.5THMF target adapter (for a 0.5"" SMR). You may also wish to order part number 15478 (see image below right) to hold the THMF in place during installation, assuring flushness and perpendicularity with the mounting surface. The installation plate is secured to the THMF using one of the target adapters (see image below left) while the adhesive cures.</p>

The 0.5THC-H clamps allow the SMR to rotate horizontally, with a 200° range of motion. The 0.5THC-V clamps allow the SMR to rotate vertically, with a 90° range of motion (allowing the SMR to point straight up).

This offset-magnet approach helps to hold the adapter in place while the SMR is removed and the transfer punch is inserted through the precision center hole.

<div class=""tabs"">
</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"">The <strong>0.5THSC</strong> magnetic adapter is used to gather quick data points over a range of hole sizes using a single adapter. The secret is a spring-loaded, cone-shaped, locating plunger (see illustration below). This adapter will locate on hole sizes 0.100"" to 0.420"" (2.5mm to 10.5mm). Keep in mind that we can also make these adapters to fit other hole diameters on request. Three strong magnets on the bottom keep the adapter squarely on any ferrous surface, and counteract the spring-loaded force of the plunger. The adapter is reliable and repeatable. A grooved profile around the outer perimeter assists in removal after measuring is finished. The adapter holds the centerpoint of a 0.5"" diameter SMR 1.000"" (or 25mm for the metric version) above the surface of the part and on centerline of the hole to a tolerance of ±0.0005"" (±0.013mm). The SMR seats on a conical land and is held in place by a magnet.<br> </br></div>

<div class=""tabs"">
</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"">The <strong>0.5THSC</strong> magnetic adapter is used to gather quick data points over a range of hole sizes using a single adapter. The secret is a spring-loaded, cone-shaped, locating plunger (see illustration below). This adapter will locate on hole sizes 0.100"" to 0.420"" (2.5mm to 10.5mm). Keep in mind that we can also make these adapters to fit other hole diameters on request. Three strong magnets on the bottom keep the adapter squarely on any ferrous surface, and counteract the spring-loaded force of the plunger. The adapter is reliable and repeatable. A grooved profile around the outer perimeter assists in removal after measuring is finished. The adapter holds the centerpoint of a 0.5"" diameter SMR 1.000"" (or 25mm for the metric version) above the surface of the part and on centerline of the hole to a tolerance of ±0.0005"" (±0.013mm). The SMR seats on a conical land and is held in place by a magnet.<br> </br></div>

<p>The magnets are provided (one per adapter) but not installed. This is so that you can heat treat the entire fixture after all adapters are welded on (if desired) without affecting the magnetism of the magnets.

</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"">The <strong>0.875THSC</strong> magnetic adapter is used to gather quick data points over a range of hole sizes using a single adapter.  The secret is a spring-loaded, cone-shaped, locating plunger (see illustration below). This adapter will locate on hole sizes 0.100"" to 0.625"" (2.5mm to 15.9mm). Keep in mind that we can also make these adapters to fit other hole diameters on request. Three strong magnets on the bottom keep the adapter squarely on any ferrous surface, and counteract the spring-loaded force of the plunger. The adapter is reliable and repeatable. A knurled profile around the outer perimeter assists in removal after measuring is finished. The adapter holds the centerpoint of a 0.875"" diameter SMR 1.500"" (or 40mm for the metric version) above the surface of the part and on centerline of the hole to a tolerance of ±0.0005"" (±0.013mm).

The SMR seats on a 3-point conical land and is held in place by a strong magnet. The discontinuous three point mounting system gives extra room for the SMR to be tilted further away from the bar's main axis, giving additional mounting flexibility.

The adapter holds the centerpoint of a 1.5"" diameter SMR 1.000"" (or 25 mm) above the surface of the part and on centerline of the shank to a tolerance of ±0.0005"" (0.013 mm). The SMR seats on a 3-point conical land and is held in place by a magnet. An optical alley allows the SMR to be rotated down for a lower shooting angle.</p>

<div class=""tabs"">
</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"">The <strong>1.5THCP</strong> magnetic adapter is an SMR nest which doubles as a transfer punch locator, allowing you to mark a point directly under the SMR. The magnet in the 1.5THCP is positioned to create a somewhat stronger bond on the bottom than on the top. This offset-magnet approach helps to hold the adapter in place while the SMR is removed and the transfer punch is inserted through the precision center hole. The center hole is true to the center of the SMR within ±0.001"" (±0.026mm). An optical alley is provided to allow negative viewing angles, and step edges allow for a better grip. The transfer punch is included.</div>

An example would be when shooting a level plane above a machine surface, and you need to extend your scales above the surface using our Invar System. Using a 12410 tip as a hard, ""point source"" terminator for an Invar stack, with a scale and scale level on top accomplishes the goal. Other uses include measuring from two surfaces to a midpoint, using a scale read from both directions to determine a distance between the surfaces.&nbsp;</div>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We can easily create flexible solutions for you. You can choose any combination of tubing lengths from our Invar series, or tell us the custom lengths that you'd like to have.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our Invar tubing series includes the 12473 Series (Extension grade), the <strong>12409 Series</strong> (Standard grade), or the <strong>12587 Series </strong>(Calibration grade). The grades indicate the tubing length tolerance held. These items are exactly the same as we use in our standard kits. All have the advantage of <a title=""About Invar"" href=""http://brunson.us/metrology-optical-measurement-products-alignment-about-our-products/about-invar/"">Invar alloy</a>, which maintains a much more constant length over varying temperatures than almost any other metal.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Or, if you don't see what you want in our standard lengths of Invar System tubing, let our factory fabricate exactly what you need. You tell us the length and the tolerance, and we'll tell you if we can do it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our Invar tubing is 1"" diameter, with short stainless steel plugs inserted permanently in each end. These plugs have internal threads (3/8""-24) and accommodate any of our <a href=""http://brunson.us/product-category/alignment-solutions/optical-tooling-products/scale-holders-ot/scale-extensions-ot/"">Invar System components</a>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The bars come in both metric and English units, with your choice of three different length tolerances in each unit system.</p>

For easy identification by our customers who have both, our English Invar tubes have a red PVC jacket, and our metric tubes have a yellow jacket.<em> (Note: All of the 12473 ""extension grade"" bars are wrapped with black PVC, regardless of whether they are English or metric.)</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The <strong>12473 Series</strong> are the same items found in our ""extension grade"" Invar kits, and are manufactured to a tolerance of +-0.050"" or +-1.27mm. These are used for simple scale extensions or other applications where a stable bar length is more important than a precisely known length.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The <strong>12409 Series</strong> are the same items found in our ""standard"" Invar kits, and are manufactured to our standard tolerances (+-0.0003"" or +-0.008 mm).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The <strong>12587 Series</strong> are the same items found in our ""calibration"" Invar kits, and are manufactured to a tighter length tolerance specification (+-0.0001"" or +-0.003 mm). In addition, the 12587 Series bars come with a NIST traceable certification specifying their exact length, to the closest 0.0001"" or 0.003 mm.</p>

</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"">The <strong>15079</strong> Laptop Tray is very handy when you're measuring with an instrument which requires connection to a computer. A rigid aluminum frame clamps onto the outer tube of your stand. It has a rubber liner to minimize abrasion on the tube. A lightweight but rigid aluminum arm holds the laptop tray at a comfortable operating height. The tray may be tilted in any direction by way of a ball-and-socket clamping mechanism (see picture below), keeping your computer close to the action. The laptop is held firmly on the tray with spring clamps on each side.</div>

<p>The laptop tray clamps to many of our heavy duty adjustable and fixed stands (see compatibility information below). The design of the laptop tray support keeps the computer up and out of the way of the adjustments you need to make to the stand. The back of the computer is held approximately 10"" (25cm) inches away from the stand's centerline, which leaves you with access to the stand and instrument.</p>

<div>
<p>The <strong>160 Series</strong> coordinate optical micrometer literally adds a another dimension to precision alignment. We mounted two optical flats in an aluminum housing so that their axes of rotation are at 90 degrees &plusmn;15 arcseconds. This allows you to monitor two dimensions simultaneously. Many types of bore analysis jobs typically require this type of dual dimensional control. The 160 will effectively convert any transit or level into an alignment telescope for this type of application. Each micrometer translates the line of sight with an accuracy of &plusmn;0.0005"" (or &plusmn;0.01mm). The cast aluminum housing has a 1.655"" opening to fit the telescope barrel of all Brunson optical tooling transits and levels. Any of four machined slots in the housing (located at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions) fit over a locating pin on Brunson telescope barrels for quick and accurate indexing of the micrometer. A precision glass window acts as a dust cover to protect the optical flats inside. The 160 is available in both English and metric units (refer to the table below).</p>

</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"">The <strong>190</strong> optical micrometer translates the line of sight laterally with an accuracy of ±0.0005"" using an optical flat. The cast aluminum housing has a 1.655"" opening to fit the telescope barrel of all Brunson optical tooling transits and levels. Adapters are available which allow this micrometer to be used with a variety of theodolites as well. Any of four machined slots in the housing (located at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions) fit over a locating pin on Brunson telescope barrels for quick and accurate indexing of the micrometer to a horizontal or vertical position. A precision glass window acts as a dust cover to protect the optical flat inside. Refer to the table below for descriptions of the various models in this series.</div>

<div>
<div>The<strong> 194-TM</strong> is standard on all of our optical tooling transits and levels. It allows fast, accurate leveling of these instruments. Like many of our levels, both ends of the bubble are viewed simultaneously by using prisms and a magnification system. This ""coincidence"" or ""split"" bubble presentation ensures the most accurate reading of the position of the bubble (see sketch left). The bubble is conveniently viewed from any position via the 360-degree rotating turret assembly on top of the unit, which provides a magnified image to increase readability. This feature is especially critical when working on substandard foundations, keeping the instrument operator from chasing his or her own weight around the instrument. A rotating light reflector provides illumination using ambient sources, and has one white and one mirrored side. The 194-TM will indicate off-level conditions as small as one arcsecond.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>The final word in stability</h2>
<div class=""tabs"" id=""content-container"">
</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The <strong>230-F Series</strong> stands are a great solution when absolute stability is required, and no vertical height adjustment is needed. Often the perfect choice for tracker, scanner, or portable CMM arm applications, the 230-F Series stands give you performance that is as solid as a rock, and easy on your budget as well. This stand comes in several heights (see table below) and is also available in custom heights as required. Permanently mounted on top of this stand is an adapter with an external 3½""-8 instrument thread. Note that our 234 Series extension tubes are often used with the 230-F stands when accommodation of various fixed heights is required.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As stated, this stand maintains instrument position extremely well, but is not the type of stand that you throw over your shoulder and carry around. Mobility around the shop floor is permitted using the drop-down casters under the heavy-duty tribrach base which are engaged and released by a foot pedal. The stand rests on three adjustable 5/8""-11 trivet bolts when the casters are retracted.</p>

<h2>The final word in stability</h2>
<div class=""tabs"" id=""content-container"">
</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The <strong>230-F Series</strong> stands are a great solution when absolute stability is required, and no vertical height adjustment is needed. Often the perfect choice for tracker, scanner, or portable CMM arm applications, the 230-F Series stands give you performance that is as solid as a rock, and easy on your budget as well. This stand comes in several heights (see table below) and is also available in custom heights as required. Permanently mounted on top of this stand is an adapter with an external 3½""-8 instrument thread. Note that our 234 Series extension tubes are often used with the 230-F stands when accommodation of various fixed heights is required.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As stated, this stand maintains instrument position extremely well, but is not the type of stand that you throw over your shoulder and carry around. Mobility around the shop floor is permitted using the drop-down casters under the heavy-duty tribrach base which are engaged and released by a foot pedal. The stand rests on three adjustable 5/8""-11 trivet bolts when the casters are retracted.</p>

<div>This stand is generally used to support all types of metrology instrumentation, from portable CMM arms to laser trackers and scanners, to laser alignment devices, particularly when working with surface plates, machine tables, way checking, and assembly operations. Stability is the key word here; this stand maintains instrument position very well, but it is not the type of stand that you throw over your shoulder and carry around! Mobility around the shop floor is permitted using the drop-down casters under the heavy-duty tribrach base which are engaged and released by a foot pedal. An air-check mechanism provides backup protection to prevent sudden drops of the instrument column in case the operator simultaneously releases the collar lock and main handle while disengaging the ratchet pawl.

<div id=""copy"" class=""tab"" style=""text-align: justify;"">Our <strong>232 Series&nbsp;</strong>stands are great for those special jobs where reaching the heights is required. The 232 is available in a number of configurations, whose working heights range from a minimum of <strong><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">67"" (1.7 m)</span></strong> to as high as <span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>112"" (2.84 m)</strong></span>, depending upon the configuration desired. Stand height is measured from the floor to the top of the intermediate tube, on which all instrument mount accessories are attached. This height specification does not include the added height and range any of our stand accessories or instrument adapters.
<p>A wide variety of our stand adapters, slides, lifts, and various instrument mounts fit into the intermediate tube, which is outfitted with the same 2.825""-20 thread as the intermediate tube on our other, shorter stands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 232 Series is also available in a ""hollow"" version, which means that there is an unobstructed vertical path straight down through the center of the stand. This is useful in certain applications when it is critical to position the stand over a specific point. Any stand or accessory designated as ""hollow"" has this characteristic.</p>
<p>Stands in this group are used to support all types of metrology instrumentation, and customers who use this stand need stability in high places. Mobility around the shop floor is permitted using the drop-down casters under the heavy-duty tribrach base which are engaged and released by a handwheel crank mechanism. An air-check mechanism provides backup protection to prevent sudden drops of the instrument column in case the operator simultaneously releases the collar lock and main handle while disengaging the ratchet pawl.</p>
<p>For general information about this stand, you can read more about our heavy duty stands on this website.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: If these stands are not tall enough for you, check out the 232-SP Series stands, or contact us for a custom stand quote. We have built various stands and vertical tooling bars as high as 40 feet.</em></p>

<h2>The Really Tall Ones</h2>
<div class=""tabs"" id=""content-container"">
</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"" style=""text-align: justify;"">Sometimes you really need to reach the sky with a stable metrology platform. Our <strong>232-SP Series</strong> stands are made for such occasions. The 232-SP is available in three configurations whose working heights range from a minimum of <span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>10' 2"" (3.1 m)</strong></span> to as high as <strong><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">37' 4"" (11.4 m)</span></strong>, depending upon the model. Stand height is measured from the floor to the top of the intermediate tube, on which all instrument mount accessories are attached. This height specification does not include the added height and range any of our stand accessories or instrument adapters.
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A wide variety of our stand adapters, slides, lifts, and various instrument mounts fit into the intermediate tube, which is outfitted with the same 2.825""-20 thread as the intermediate tube on our other, shorter stands. Refer to the chart below for the various stock options, or request your own custom variation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Stands in this group are used to support all types of metrology instrumentation, and customers who use this stand need a great deal of stability in some very high places. For instance, some of our customers use them in high-bay satellite assembly facilities. Mobility around the shop floor is permitted using the casters (once the trivet ""feet"" are manually retracted) under the heavy-duty tribrach base. An air-check mechanism provides backup protection to prevent sudden drops of the instrument column in case the operator simultaneously releases the collar lock and main handle while disengaging the ratchet pawl.</p>

<div class=""tabs"" id=""content-container"">

<p>The <strong>234 Series</strong> of stand extensions increase the effective stand height from 3"" (7.6 cm) to 48"" (122 cm), depending upon model (see table below). Although these tubes are not designed to provide a precision height standard, metric extension tubes are also available as a complement to an all-metric system. Made of your choice of heavy-walled steel or aluminum tubing with a standard 3½""-8 thread on each end (one internal on the bottom to fit the stand, and one external on the top to fit an instrument or adapter). Other lengths and thread specifications are available by special order.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Extension tubes are provided to increase versatility of measurement systems. Excessive stand height build-up using extension tubes is not recommended due to the possibility of decreased stability and accuracy.</p>

<div class=""tabs"" id=""content-container"">

<p>The <strong>234 Series</strong> of stand extensions increase the effective stand height from 3"" (7.6 cm) to 48"" (122 cm), depending upon model (see table below). Although these tubes are not designed to provide a precision height standard, metric extension tubes are also available as a complement to an all-metric system. Made of your choice of heavy-walled steel or aluminum tubing with a standard 3½""-8 thread on each end (one internal on the bottom to fit the stand, and one external on the top to fit an instrument or adapter). Other lengths and thread specifications are available by special order.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Extension tubes are provided to increase versatility of measurement systems. Excessive stand height build-up using extension tubes is not recommended due to the possibility of decreased stability and accuracy.</p>

<div class=""tabs"" id=""content-container"">

<p>The <strong>234 Series</strong> of stand extensions increase the effective stand height from 3"" (7.6 cm) to 48"" (122 cm), depending upon model (see table below). Although these tubes are not designed to provide a precision height standard, metric extension tubes are also available as a complement to an all-metric system. Made of your choice of heavy-walled steel or aluminum tubing with a standard 3½""-8 thread on each end (one internal on the bottom to fit the stand, and one external on the top to fit an instrument or adapter). Other lengths and thread specifications are available by special order.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Extension tubes are provided to increase versatility of measurement systems. Excessive stand height build-up using extension tubes is not recommended due to the possibility of decreased stability and accuracy.</p>

<div class=""tabs"" id=""content-container"">

<p>The <strong>234 Series</strong> of stand extensions increase the effective stand height from 3"" (7.6 cm) to 48"" (122 cm), depending upon model (see table below). Although these tubes are not designed to provide a precision height standard, metric extension tubes are also available as a complement to an all-metric system. Made of your choice of heavy-walled steel or aluminum tubing with a standard 3½""-8 thread on each end (one internal on the bottom to fit the stand, and one external on the top to fit an instrument or adapter). Other lengths and thread specifications are available by special order.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Extension tubes are provided to increase versatility of measurement systems. Excessive stand height build-up using extension tubes is not recommended due to the possibility of decreased stability and accuracy.</p>

<p>The <strong>234 Series</strong> of stand extensions increase the effective stand height from 3"" (7.6 cm) to 48"" (122 cm), depending upon model (see table below). Although these tubes are not designed to provide a precision height standard, metric extension tubes are also available as a complement to an all-metric system. Made of your choice of heavy-walled steel or aluminum tubing with a standard 3½""-8 thread on each end (one internal on the bottom to fit the stand, and one external on the top to fit an instrument or adapter). Other lengths and thread specifications are available by special order.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Extension tubes are provided to increase versatility of measurement systems. Excessive stand height build-up using extension tubes is not recommended due to the possibility of decreased stability and accuracy.</p>

<div class=""tabs"" id=""content-container"">

<p>The <strong>234 Series</strong> of stand extensions increase the effective stand height from 3"" (7.6 cm) to 48"" (122 cm), depending upon model (see table below). Although these tubes are not designed to provide a precision height standard, metric extension tubes are also available as a complement to an all-metric system. Made of your choice of heavy-walled steel or aluminum tubing with a standard 3½""-8 thread on each end (one internal on the bottom to fit the stand, and one external on the top to fit an instrument or adapter). Other lengths and thread specifications are available by special order.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Extension tubes are provided to increase versatility of measurement systems. Excessive stand height build-up using extension tubes is not recommended due to the possibility of decreased stability and accuracy.</p>

Made of your choice of heavy-walled steel or aluminum tubing with a standard 3½""-8 thread on each end (one internal on the bottom to fit the stand, and one external on the top to fit an instrument or adapter). Other lengths and thread specifications are available by special order.</p>

<div class=""tabs"" id=""content-container"">

<p>The <strong>234 Series</strong> of stand extensions increase the effective stand height from 3"" (7.6 cm) to 48"" (122 cm), depending upon model (see table below). Although these tubes are not designed to provide a precision height standard, metric extension tubes are also available as a complement to an all-metric system. Made of your choice of heavy-walled steel or aluminum tubing with a standard 3½""-8 thread on each end (one internal on the bottom to fit the stand, and one external on the top to fit an instrument or adapter). Other lengths and thread specifications are available by special order.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Extension tubes are provided to increase versatility of measurement systems. Excessive stand height build-up using extension tubes is not recommended due to the possibility of decreased stability and accuracy.</p>

<p>The <strong>234 Series</strong> of stand extensions increase the effective stand height from 3"" (7.6 cm) to 48"" (122 cm), depending upon model (see table below). Although these tubes are not designed to provide a precision height standard, metric extension tubes are also available as a complement to an all-metric system. Made of your choice of heavy-walled steel or aluminum tubing with a standard 3½""-8 thread on each end (one internal on the bottom to fit the stand, and one external on the top to fit an instrument or adapter). Other lengths and thread specifications are available by special order.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Extension tubes are provided to increase versatility of measurement systems. Excessive stand height build-up using extension tubes is not recommended due to the possibility of decreased stability and accuracy.</p>

<p>The <strong>234 Series</strong> of stand extensions increase the effective stand height from 3"" (7.6 cm) to 48"" (122 cm), depending upon model (see table below). Although these tubes are not designed to provide a precision height standard, metric extension tubes are also available as a complement to an all-metric system. Made of your choice of heavy-walled steel or aluminum tubing with a standard 3½""-8 thread on each end (one internal on the bottom to fit the stand, and one external on the top to fit an instrument or adapter). Other lengths and thread specifications are available by special order.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Extension tubes are provided to increase versatility of measurement systems. Excessive stand height build-up using extension tubes is not recommended due to the possibility of decreased stability and accuracy.</p>

<div>The <strong>237</strong> is ideal for general shop applications and assembly areas where very low, very stable setups are required. This stand employs a scissors-type lifting mechanism which easily moves its heavy-duty aluminum framework into any working position between <strong><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">7"" (17.8 cm)</span></strong> and <strong><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">37"" (94 cm)</span></strong>, as measured from the floor to the instrument interface surface. This height specification does not include the added height and range of any of our stand accessories or instrument adapters. The flexibility and mobility offered by the 237 allows alignment and leveling operations near the floor as well as at average surface plate heights.
<p><br />The 237 metrology stand provides a standard 3½""-8 external thread for instrument mounting and also has the same 2.825""-20 internal threads as the intermediate tubes in a number of our other stands. (See below for a list of compatible products.)</p>
<p>The base is cast iron for strength and stability; the superstructure is aluminum for maximum rigidity with minimum weight. The instrument mount is raised and lowered by a recirculating ball nut lead screw. The stand may be locked in any position. A foot pedal engages or disengages three casters; when these casters are retracted, the stand rests on three adjustable trivet points with lock screws. This makes it possible to rough-level the stand on uneven surfaces.</p>
<p>As shown below, the 237 ""groundhog"" stand may be lowered to within a few inches of the floor, or secured in any position up to its full height.</p>

Translation adjustments (four laterally opposing screws) are provided to set the target concentric to the center of rotation, while angular adjustments (three spring-loaded screws at 120°) set the mirror precisely perpendicular to the shaft's rotational centerline. By setting an optical instrument to the mirror, precise extension of the shaft rotational axis is ensured.</p>
<p><span>The 284-M mirror provides a reference LOS (line of sight) on rotational axes such as drive lines, gearbox output shafts, ship's propeller shafts, generator centerlines, etc. Once an instrument is aligned with the rotational axes, various tasks may be performed to relate or evaluate the position of other items (such as machine ways, bearing journals, bores, etc.) to the original rotational axis.</span></p>

<div class=""tabs"" id=""content-container"">
</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"" style=""text-align: justify;"">The <strong>390</strong> variable wedge is an important tool for calibration of optical instruments.  This item is made to fit over the front flanges of the horizontal or down-pointing instrument mount tubes on our model 270BN Calibration Test Stand. Two thumbscrews securely lock the 390 to the tube flanges.  It can then be used to measure angular deviation from optimal during optical instrument calibration.  An integrated glass block is rotated manually to produce a measurable angular deviation in any line of sight which is roughly normal to the glass.  The ""zero point"" on the graduated scale may be rotated to either a horizontal or vertical position (index marks may be seen in the picture at the 12 o'clock and 3 o'clock positions), allowing either horizontal or vertical measurements to be made without physically relocating the entire unit.</div>

<h2>Flexible System for Target Placement and Centering</h2>
<div class=""tabs"" id=""content-container"">
</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our <strong>406 Series</strong> Bore Targets may be used to establish centerlines of large cylindrical units or bores such as extruder tubes, crankshaft bores, turbine/ generator bores, etc. The compact and flexible design accommodates a wide range of bore diameters.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Two models are available in this series: the model <strong>406-6</strong> accommodates a maximum bore diameter of 60"" (1.52m), while the <strong>406-6A</strong> can handle a bore up to 150"" (3.8m) in diameter.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The unit is made for quick and easy field setup. Stability is assured with solid leg connections (rather than telescoping legs) and the use of ""sleds"" as feet - no more targets slipping or falling out of bores during your alignment. This feature makes the 406 Series ideal for half-bore and vertical applications. Leg design helps to minimize sag.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-1032"" title=""Bore Target"" alt="""" src=""{{store url=""""}}wp-content/uploads/2013/03/406MultBearing.jpg"" width=""390"" height=""193""></img></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In use, the target is first positioned roughly in the bore center with adjustable feet, then the central target holder is ""indicated in"". This is achieved using the dial indicator, which is mounted on a sweep arm connected to a rotating central hub. The hub, in turn, contains the optical target. The central hub is adjustable so that it - and therefore the target - may be brought to dead center. This process also reveals and quantifies any out-of-round conditions in the bore.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-1033"" title=""Bore Target"" alt="""" src=""{{store url=""""}}wp-content/uploads/2013/03/406-6HalfBorexSmall.jpg"" width=""192"" height=""121""></img></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When used in half-bore configurations, the horizontal legs are situated just below the bore's centerline (photo at right).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The target holder is sized for any 2¼"" diameter target. The kit includes a <a title=""795 2 ¼"" href=""http://brunson.us/shop/metrology-3d-measurement-optical-targets-open-wire-see-through-795/"">795</a> multi-shot distance target. The legs terminate in ball feet or sleds, as desired by the user (both are included). The target holder also has unique adjustments for calibration of wire targets.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a href=""{{store url=""""}}wp-content/uploads/2013/03/406-6SmallBore.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2479"" title=""406-6 in small bore configuration"" alt="""" src=""{{store url=""""}}wp-content/uploads/2013/03/406-6SmallBore-160x146.jpg"" width=""160"" height=""146""></img></a>At left, the 406-6 is shown in small bore configuration. The indicator initially mounts in the target holder. After the central hub is brought to the center of the bore, the indicator is removed and replaced with the optical target.</p>

<h2>Flexible System for Target Placement and Centering</h2>
<div class=""tabs"" id=""content-container"">
</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our <strong>406 Series</strong> Bore Targets may be used to establish centerlines of large cylindrical units or bores such as extruder tubes, crankshaft bores, turbine/ generator bores, etc. The compact and flexible design accommodates a wide range of bore diameters.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Two models are available in this series: the model <strong>406-6</strong> accommodates a maximum bore diameter of 60"" (1.52m), while the <strong>406-6A</strong> can handle a bore up to 150"" (3.8m) in diameter.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The unit is made for quick and easy field setup. Stability is assured with solid leg connections (rather than telescoping legs) and the use of ""sleds"" as feet - no more targets slipping or falling out of bores during your alignment. This feature makes the 406 Series ideal for half-bore and vertical applications. Leg design helps to minimize sag.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-1032"" title=""Bore Target"" alt="""" src=""{{store url=""""}}wp-content/uploads/2013/03/406MultBearing.jpg"" width=""390"" height=""193""></img></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In use, the target is first positioned roughly in the bore center with adjustable feet, then the central target holder is ""indicated in"". This is achieved using the dial indicator, which is mounted on a sweep arm connected to a rotating central hub. The hub, in turn, contains the optical target. The central hub is adjustable so that it - and therefore the target - may be brought to dead center. This process also reveals and quantifies any out-of-round conditions in the bore.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-1033"" title=""Bore Target"" alt="""" src=""{{store url=""""}}wp-content/uploads/2013/03/406-6HalfBorexSmall.jpg"" width=""192"" height=""121""></img></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When used in half-bore configurations, the horizontal legs are situated just below the bore's centerline (photo at right).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The target holder is sized for any 2¼"" diameter target. The kit includes a <a title=""795 2 ¼"" href=""http://brunson.us/shop/metrology-3d-measurement-optical-targets-open-wire-see-through-795/"">795</a> multi-shot distance target. The legs terminate in ball feet or sleds, as desired by the user (both are included). The target holder also has unique adjustments for calibration of wire targets.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a href=""{{store url=""""}}wp-content/uploads/2013/03/406-6SmallBore.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2479"" title=""406-6 in small bore configuration"" alt="""" src=""{{store url=""""}}wp-content/uploads/2013/03/406-6SmallBore-160x146.jpg"" width=""160"" height=""146""></img></a>At left, the 406-6 is shown in small bore configuration. The indicator initially mounts in the target holder. After the central hub is brought to the center of the bore, the indicator is removed and replaced with the optical target.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">At left below, the 406-6 bore target kit comes complete in a polyurethane case with foam inserts. Each 406 Series Bore Target Kit contains the components shown at right below (see table below for component listing).</p>

<div>Also known as an ""angle generator,"" the <strong>470NA</strong> facilitates checking, calibration, and adjustment of devices that measure small angles. The removable tilting plate is a surface-table quality black granite bar with a work area of 5&frac12;"" x 24"" (14 x 61 cm). The tilting table is controlled by a lever assembly actuated by a micrometer. The unit is calibrated so that 0.001"" of micrometer motion equals 1 arcsecond of tilt. The large, easy-to-read micrometer thimble is directly readable to 0.0001"", which corresponds to a tilt resolution of 0.1 arcseconds.</div>
<div><br />The granite bar is supported in three places by steel plugs with carbide inserts, which in turn rest on steel balls. A pivot ball on the lever arm supports the surface plate and is mounted in an eccentric bushing, which provides for precise factory adjustment and calibration in the field if necessary. The calibration of this unit is traceable to NIST.</div>
<div><br />Two steel plates provide a corner reference stop that may be used to position any test unit on the granite bar. The cast iron base is supported by three adjustable foot screws, permitting transverse and lateral leveling of the unit. These foot screws each have a locknut to prevent inadvertent movement. An eccentric lifting mechanism is also provided to raise the granite bar off of its resting points when not in use.</div>",<strong>Ships in 8 Weeks</strong>

</div><div id=""copy"">The <strong>5030 </strong>stand provides a rigid support for various measuring instruments. Triangular bracing of the legs enhances stability. The legs are removable and the telescoping lower leg sections retract for compact storage and easy transport.
<p>The stand height is adjustable from <span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>31 in to 51½ in (78.7 cm - 131 cm)</strong></span> using the center column and telescoping legs. A spoked handwheel below the instrument mount permits fine height adjustment of the center column within a range of 3"" (7.6 cm). A positive hand clamp gives extra assurance against accidental height changes. The swivel head at the top can be rotated through 360° and locked in any position. A standard 3½""-8 thread allows attachment of various adapters or instruments. The column and swivel head are hollow, providing a 1 1/8"" diameter clear aperture for downward sighting. A removable plastic cap protects the mounting ring when the stand is not in use.</p>

<div id=""content-container"">
</div><div id=""copy"">
<p>Our models <strong>509</strong> (battery powered) and <strong>509-AC</strong> (AC powered) light sources fit our various instruments and accessories to provide reticle or target illumination for alignment functions. Many of our optical tooling instruments are capable of performing alignment functions such as autoreflection, collimation, autocollimation, colineation, and reticle projection. However, a light source is required to illuminate the reticle in all of these procedures.</p>
<p>Cool source lighting is provided by a white LED lamp which is almost as bright as our old fiberoptic light sources and which has a 100,000 hour life. The light source is powered by three common button cell batteries (included) that provide 100 hours of illumination. The light source casing is made of stainless steel and incorporates a water resistant seal, making it tough enough for your most challenging industrial environments. The twist-on, twist-off feature means there are no switches or wires to break. Its compact size fits easily in your pocket, instrument case or tool box. You can even plunge a transit with a 509 light source installed.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we offer the model 509-AC light source when the freedom and convenience of battery operation is just too much to bear. The 509-AC includes a lightweight multi-input voltage (100-240V) transformer with multiple plug configurations, which allows this unit to operate worldwide.</p>
<p>To use this light source as a target backlight on our 521-B spherical mount, order accessory 509-SMB. To use this light source as a target backlight for Taylor Hobson's 112/376 spherical mount, order accessory 509-SMTH.</p>

<p>The 5150 includes three interchangeable front mounts (A, B, and C in the picture to the left) to accommodate various telescope configurations. Mount ""A"" is a double cone, used to support an alignment telescope having no spherical mount or optical square. The photograph at the top shows the 5150 configured with mount A. Mounts ""B"" and ""C"" are cup mounts. The short one (B) is provided for use with a spherical mount, and the longer one (C) is used with our optical squares. The cup itself is easily removed from one of the mounts and installed on the other.</p>
<p><span>The cross slide supporting the telescope has an adjustment range of 2.875"" (73mm), and is moved by way of a hand wheel mounted on the side. A large handwheel near the bottom of the unit allows very fine vertical adjustments. The range of vertical adjustment is 2.375"" (60.3mm). A 3½""-8 thread is provided in the base plate for mounting the 5150 to an instrument stand if desired.</span></p>

<p>The <strong>5170</strong> base supports and provides a means for adjusting the position of alignment telescopes and collimators. It can be attached to any standard cup mount, such as our 560-2 Adjustable Cup Mount. The yoke is easily repositioned on the base so that setups may be made with the base secured in a vertical, inclined, or upside-down position. With the addition of the Extension Arm 5175, the base can be used with an alignment telescope along with an attached Optical Square 2410 or 2412. (Note that the 2410 and 2412 are no longer manufactured.)</p>
<p>It must be noted that the 5170 is <strong>not</strong> a stand-alone instrument mount. It <strong>must be used</strong> in conjunction with a spherical mounting system such as the 560-2 with the 521-B. The spherical mounting system supports the objective end of the telescope, and also provides the means for mounting the 5170 to a stand or a surface. Once mounted, the 5170 then provides an easy way to make azimuth and elevation angle adjustments to the telescope near the eyepiece, using the spherical mount as the pivot point. The entire assembly is then secured by the 560-2 cup mount which may be bolted to a surface or may be mounted on a stand using our 5144 stand adapter.</p>

<div class=""tabs"">
</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"">
<p>The <strong>160 Series</strong> coordinate optical micrometer literally adds a another dimension to precision alignment. We mounted two optical flats in an aluminum housing so that their axes of rotation are at 90 degrees ±15 arcseconds. This allows you to monitor two dimensions simultaneously. Many types of bore analysis jobs typically require this type of dual dimensional control. The 160 will effectively convert any transit or level into an alignment telescope for this type of application. Each micrometer translates the line of sight with an accuracy of ±0.0005"" (or ±0.01mm). The cast aluminum housing has a 1.655"" opening to fit the telescope barrel of all Brunson optical tooling transits and levels. Any of four machined slots in the housing (located at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions) fit over a locating pin on Brunson telescope barrels for quick and accurate indexing of the micrometer. A precision glass window acts as a dust cover to protect the optical flats inside. The 160 is available in both English and metric units (refer to the table below).</p>

<div class=""tab"">Measure smooth, knurled, or spiked rolls with the 567. The magnetic v-base holds securely to rolls having diameters from 4.5"" (11.2 cm) to 13.5"" (34.2 cm), for easy horizontal and vertical measurements. Simply position the magnetic scale holder assembly (567-A) in the circular recess and slide the scale to contact the roll surface below. The scale holder may be rotated to any convenient viewing angle and set level with the integrated bubble vial.</div>

<div id=""copy"" class=""tab"">Three-dimensional measurement systems employing theodolites or total stations often require an artifact of known length in order to calibrate the system prior to data collection. That's where the <strong>6000-CE</strong> and <strong>6000-CM</strong> come in. These artifacts may also be used for verification of system accuracy at various times during a ""shoot"". These special scales, when used with our Invar scale extension kits, provide the required calibration index for such systems. A bull's eye target with three consecutive circles is located on a white face scale at a precisely calibrated distance from the reference end of the scale. Two calibration scales are available (see table below).</div>
<div class=""tab"">&nbsp;</div>
<div class=""tab"">The scales are made using the same process as our optical tooling scales. They have a hardened steel substrate, with black lettering on a matte white background and a non-glare topcoat.</div>
<div class=""tab"">&nbsp;</div>
<div class=""tab"">The 6000-CE and 6000-CM are designed for use in pairs, with our calibration-grade Invar kits. The English unit kit is 803-C; the metric unit kit is the 803-MC. These kits include one fixed and one rotating scale holder so that the optical targets on each end can be oriented in the same direction.</div>
<div class=""tab"">&nbsp;</div>
<div class=""tab"">Each scale is shipped in a vinyl sheath.</div>

<div class=""tabs"">
</div><div class=""tab"">The <strong>740-A</strong> Floor Target Holder provides a permanent mount for optical targets, and may be grouted into a floor or other surface. Great for offset centerlines or holding other reference lines that must be used for alignment again and again. The ¼"" target mount is fully adjustable in the X-Y plane using three socket head set screws which surround the target (design sketch below). A threaded cap with large screwdriver slot protects the target mount from harm while not being used. Milled slots on the side of the holder body give extra grip and help prevent rotation once grouted in place. Three threaded holes on the top surface of the holder body (just under the cap) allow the use of our mounting/leveling fixture for perfect placement while grouting.</div>

<div>The <strong>771-H190</strong> is our most basic transit. It is great for establishing vertical and horizontal reference planes as well as straight lines. Its name derives from its original use in the building and certification of jigs and fixtures used in aircraft construction. Like our other transits, the line of sight is maintained mutually orthogonal, as well as coincident, with the horizontal and vertical axes. This yields extremely precise, short to medium range alignment capabilities. It has precision telescope optics mounted on a solid-cast bronze horizontal axle which combine to produce a well-balanced instrument with feather-touch controls. The 771-H190 is perfect when you need to establish straight lines and flat planes on many different types of mechanical systems.</div>
<div><br />Patented ball bearing mounts permit accurate sweeping of both horizontal and vertical planes. The 771-H190 employs a 194-TM coincidence level for precision leveling. The 194-TM has a 360-degree rotating turret to view the magnified bubble image from any position.</div>
<div><br />The 771-H190 also has a hollow vertical axis that allows you to look straight down through the instrument base to see targets or collimators which are directly below the instrument.&nbsp;<br /><strong></strong></div>
<div><br /><strong>Available with English, metric, or no micrometer.</strong> Measurements from the optical reference line (the line of sight) are taken by using an optical micrometer mounted on the telescope. The 771-H may be ordered with an English-unit micrometer, a metric-unit micrometer, or no micrometer (see table below).</div>

<div id=""content-container"">
</div><div id=""copy"">The <strong>800 </strong>precision lift provides precise control of vertical motion throughout approximately ½"" (13 mm) range. It is generally used for fine vertical positioning after the instrument height has been roughly established with a stand column. A large diameter, fine-motion screw allows minute height adjustments of previously leveled instruments fast and easy, while minimizing the need to re-level the instrument. Internal guideways also minimize any azimuth (rotational) shifting. The 800's 2.825""-20 external thread fits into many of the intermediate tubes on our stands. On top, a recessed dovetail receptacle provides the interface for our lateral slides and other products. You can orient these products in any azimuth direction desired once inserted in the dovetail socket. Socket head set screws then tighten on the inserted dovetail and hold it firmly in place.

<div id=""copy"" class=""tab"">Our special <strong>803-E Invar Kit</strong> gives you an economical way to create scale extensions, or build certain types of calibration artifacts, when the only thing that's important is that the length doesn't change between measurements. We call this type of kit ""extension grade"" because the length tolerance on the Invar bars is relatively big (&plusmn;0.050"", or &plusmn;1.27 mm). The bars are not calibrated, certified, or serialized. They are simply designed to give you an economical way to hold your scales or other targets while making relative or comparative measurements, but still provide you the benefit of the low thermal coefficient properties of Invar. These properties effectively eliminate changes in length due to handling or environmental fluctuations.</div>

<div id=""copy"" class=""tab"" style=""text-align: justify;"">The <strong>803-M</strong> and <strong>803-MC Invar Kits&nbsp;</strong>are designed as multipurpose kits. They are often used as scale extension tools - precisely extending the range of standard optical tooling scales for accurate measurement of larger dimensions, or to access previously unreachable points. They are also used with calibration scales such as our 6000-CM (and others) as calibration or scaling artifacts for three dimensional measurement systems.
<p>Invar tubing is great for metrology because it has such a very low coefficient of thermal expansion. which effectively eliminates changes in length due to handling or environmental changes. This is particularly beneficial when measuring a system in its ""hot"" or running state.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The 803-M and 803-MC kits both contain exactly the same set of components; the only difference between them is that the Invar tubing is manufactured to different length tolerances. The Invar tubing in the 803-M is manufactured to its stated length within +-0.008 mm, and the Invar tubing in the 803-MC is manufactured to its stated length within +-0.003 mm. Our metric&nbsp;Invar&nbsp;tubing covered with a tough polyvinyl layer designed to protect your tubing and to allow for easy cleaning. Our metric tubing is yellow in color (English tubing is red).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In each kit, the Invar tubing components are hand-picked so that the total Invar tube stackup error does not exceed the stated maximum. This means that you can connect all of the tubes found in a given kit together end-to-end, and the stack will maintain the total length within the stackup error. (The table above right summarizes this information.)</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Individual components may be assembled to produce lengths from 25 mm to 2800 mm, in 125 mm increments.

<div id=""content-container"">
</div><div id=""copy"">Our <strong>810</strong> is a heavy duty portable stand which may be assembled by the user into a variety of configurations. It consists of a number of components which give you the flexibility to ""build"" the stand to the specification of any job which calls for portable or unique setups. It is relatively lightweight and disassembles for mobility, yet is extremely rigid while being used. Various combinations of the 810's components allow instrument mounting heights of <strong><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">2"" to 55½"" (5 - 141 cm) </span></strong>from the floor. The stand allows you to make precision vertical and horizontal adjustments to solve a multitude of instrument location problems. [In case you're scratching your head, an instrument height of 2"" is possible by installing the instrument mount tube - and the instrument - upside down between the legs of the stand.]</div>
<br>
<div>The 810 comes with a set of short legs, a set of long legs, and a set of trivet points that may be mounted directly in the three sockets on the tribrach plate, for setting the stand almost directly on the floor or other work surface. Both point and pad feet are interchangeable with the short and long legs. It is also supplied with a short and long intermediate tube. The photo above (upper left) shows the stand with the long legs and long intermediate tube; the photo below (lower left) shows the stand with the short legs and short intermediate tube.</div>

<p>The 810 comes in a sturdy polyethylene case with foam inserts to hold all parts securely, shown below.</p>

<p>A number of our stand adapters, slides, lifts, and various instrument mounts fit on the stand. Almost anything will fit on it because it is equipped not only with the 3½""-8 standard external instrument mount threads, but also our dovetail receptacle and the 2.825""-20 internal thread found on many of our intermediate tubes. For a trimmed down version of this stand, have a look at our 801-1.</p>

<p>AlignCam is a digital upgrade for Brunson's current line of alignment telescopes, levels and transits used extensively in the field. AlignCam provides a live image and continuous feedback on sight lines, so a field technician can make real time adjustments to achieve precision alignments.</p>
<p>This solution is ideal for repetitive measurement tasks and a variety of applications such as turbomachinery centerlines, drive system alignment, timber processing mills, precision leveling of machine bases, and other machine alignment challenges.</p>
<p>The AlignCam solution includes a digital camera with a high quality CCD sensor, an instrument adapter, and Brunson's TeleView<sup>®</sup> software. AlignCam's mobile option allows a single operator to view the target on a mobile device anywhere in the workspace.</p>
<p>AlignCam dramatically improves user ergonomics for completing alignment tasks in the field or the lab.</p>
<p>This system upgrade is designed for quick, on-site user installation. A field technician simply connects the camera assembly to the optical instrument, then plugs the USB cable into the camera and computer. Power is supplied to the camera via a USB cable.</p>
<h2>AlignCam Mobile Option</h2>
<p><img style=""display: block; float: right;"" alt=""AlignCam Mobile Option Kindle Fire"" src=""{{store url=""""}}wp-content/uploads/kindle-web.jpg""></img></p>

<p>The model <strong>89</strong> is a precision mounting base designed to accommodate almost all of our 2¼"" diameter alignment telescopes and collimators. The instrument is supported by two wyes which are 8.375"" (212.7mm) on center, and are mounted to a channel-sectioned bar. (Special wye spacings are available on request.) The wyes provide stable support of the instrument barrel. For added protection, adjustable metal clips secure the telescope to the base.</p>
<p>Precise rotation in a horizontal plane is controlled by the patented Brunson ball bearing spindle, similar to that of all Brunson transits. The mounting base has a standard 3½""-8 internal thread for attachment to any compatible optical tooling stand. A fine motion tangent screw allows easy azimuth control, and incorporates a wobble pin for tension relief and a stable setup. Four large-headed leveling screws in nylon bushings make tilt adjustment easy. A level vial may be ordered as extra equipment.</p>
<p>Note: The original Brunson 89 had a wye spacing of 9½"", but was modified for the somewhat smaller spacing of 8.375"" in order to fit all of the K+E design alignment telescopes.</p>

<p>Our AccuScale-DP scale bar kit greatly improves scanning accuracy and convenience when paired with DotProduct's DPI-8 handheld 3D scanner. By integrating this artifact with the DPI-8's intelligent software (Phi.3D v2.1 or later), users can fully automate workflows that simplify data acquisition, improve frame registration and achieve better global accuracy.</p>
<p>Reference artifacts commonly help qualify 3D point clouds to assure scanners measure correctly. AccuScale-DP goes a step further to scale the point cloud more accurately than a scanner is capable by itself. Three 2-meter bars may be assembled to establish scale for x, y, and z. A positionable April tag on each end of each bar allows the DPI-8 scanner to automatically detect and assign the correct scale bar length. The April tags also double as ""registration"" targets to automatically stitch scan frames together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When scanning in extreme environments, the bars' expansion or contraction is managed with input from a certified thermometer included in the kit. A watertight plastic case with foam insert protects the components.&nbsp;</p>

<div><br /><strong>KinAiry</strong> is the comprehensive, independent solution for laser tracker evaluation, utilizing NIST's new Interim Field Test Procedure IR-8016<sup>1</sup>. The KinAiry system provides a set of traceable measurements designed to verify volumetric performance in your environment. The result is a colorized graphical analysis that quickly shows the overall health of your tracker - regardless of make or model.
<div><br />
<h4>Comprehensive testing</h4>
<p>Traditional laser tracker field checks often consist of 2-face (front sight/back sight) tests or short reference bar measurements. While these have value, they don't exercise the tracker sufficiently to evaluate performance over a larger working volume. That's why NIST designed a volumetric test to assess the total health of a tracker in the field. A number of measurements are taken on a 2.3 meter bar in various orientations, strategically located to fully exercise both the ranging and angular measurement components of a tracker. The test is quick and easy to run, occupies a small footprint, and provides the ultimate confidence in laser tracker performance - right on the job.</p>
<h4>In your environment</h4>
<p>While there is no substitute for the periodic testing a laser tracker receives at the manufacturer's facility, it is equally important to be confident that the tracker survived the ride home and is operating within spec on the production floor. The role of interim field testing is to evaluate instrument performance and identify errors in conditions of actual use. It answers the question, ""How is my tracker performing right now?"" Results from interim field testing can be used as a required check in the quality audit trail, to confirm instrument performance prior to critical measurements, and to track instrument performance over time.</p>
<h4>Objective, traceable results</h4>
<p>Many companies own laser trackers from different manufacturers, all of which have built-in, firmware-specific field checks requiring operators to be fluent in various test methodologies. KinAiry consolidates these device-specific processes into one system check for any laser tracker. The operator follows a simple script to capture test points using the metrology software of choice along with KinAiry's calibrated 2.3 meter artifact in multiple positions. The data is transferred to KinAiry, where it is analyzed and presented in a colorized graphical plot comparing the tracker's actual performance against the manufacturer's Maximum Permissible Error (MPE). Now there's one field test which objectively qualifies the performance of any tracker using a NIST traceable process.

<p>The <strong>M-Series </strong> metrology stands have been requested both by customers and other metrology instrument OEMs. With their input, Brunson has designed this instrument stand for functionality and portability. This collapsible, tripod-type stand is available in a number of standard configurations. Just tell us your preference.</p>
<p><strong>Graphite or aluminum legs.</strong> These stands are available with aluminum or graphite double upper legs, which span from the shoulder pivots to the ""knee"" of the stand. Stands with graphite upper legs have a lower weight and give an advantage with respect to thermal stability.</p>
<p><strong>Adjustable or fixed instrument mount.</strong> The stand is available with either an adjustable instrument column, also called the ""intermediate tube"" (below left) or with an instrument adapter fixed directly to the tribrach at the top of the stand (below right). The adjustable instrument mount employs a handwheel-driven worm gear for up-and-down adjustment of the instrument column. The collar may then be clamped to avoid any inadvertent instrument movement. An adapter on top of the intermediate tube provides a standard external 3½""-8 thread for mounting instruments or other adapters. Note that the intermediate tubes on our M-Series portable stands do not have the same internal threads as found on our bigger stands, and as such will not directly accommodate adapters such as the model 800 precision lift.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3817"" alt=""M-Series portable stands"" src=""{{store url=""""}}wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MGSAdj+Fixed1-300x204.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""204""></img></p>
<p>The ""fixed height"" version of the stand has an adapter mounted directly to the top of the stand. For applications where fine vertical adjustment of the instrument is not necessary, this version reduces cost and increases lateral stability.</p>
<p>Note that the height of either type of stand (fixed or adjustable mount) may be adjusted by extending and locking the lower legs at the desired position.</p>

<div><strong><br>Short or tall.</br></strong><span> The M-series stands are available in a short or tall version. The double upper leg section and the adjustable instrument column of the tall version are longer, providing the additional height. The lower leg sections are the same length on both versions.</span>
<p><strong>Points or pads.</strong> The stand's lower leg will accommodate two different types of feet €“ trivet points (image left top) or swivel pad feet (image left bottom). The swivel pads have a thin, textured rubber pad on the bottom. Either type of foot is an acceptable choice for general applications. The points work well on uneven surfaces, the pads work well on smooth surfaces (e.g., finished concrete) to resist sliding and soft surfaces (e.g., linoleum) which the points may damage. Pads have the additional advantage of being outfitted with a hole for semi-permanent mounting. The feet are easily interchangeable in the field. The M-Series comes standard with both trivet point feet and pad feet.</p>

<p>The <strong>M-Series </strong> metrology stands have been requested both by customers and other metrology instrument OEMs. With their input, Brunson has designed this instrument stand for functionality and portability. This collapsible, tripod-type stand is available in a number of standard configurations. Just tell us your preference.</p>
<p><strong>Graphite or aluminum legs.</strong> These stands are available with aluminum or graphite double upper legs, which span from the shoulder pivots to the ""knee"" of the stand. Stands with graphite upper legs have a lower weight and give an advantage with respect to thermal stability.</p>
<p><strong>Adjustable or fixed instrument mount.</strong> The stand is available with either an adjustable instrument column, also called the ""intermediate tube"" (below left) or with an instrument adapter fixed directly to the tribrach at the top of the stand (below right). The adjustable instrument mount employs a handwheel-driven worm gear for up-and-down adjustment of the instrument column. The collar may then be clamped to avoid any inadvertent instrument movement. An adapter on top of the intermediate tube provides a standard external 3½""-8 thread for mounting instruments or other adapters. Note that the intermediate tubes on our M-Series portable stands do not have the same internal threads as found on our bigger stands, and as such will not directly accommodate adapters such as the model 800 precision lift.</p>

<p>The ""fixed height"" version of the stand has an adapter mounted directly to the top of the stand. For applications where fine vertical adjustment of the instrument is not necessary, this version reduces cost and increases lateral stability.</p>
<p>Note that the height of either type of stand (fixed or adjustable mount) may be adjusted by extending and locking the lower legs at the desired position.</p>

<div>The <strong>190</strong> optical micrometer translates the line of sight laterally with an accuracy of &plusmn;0.0005"" using an optical flat. The cast aluminum housing has a 1.655"" opening to fit the telescope barrel of all Brunson optical tooling transits and levels. Adapters are available which allow this micrometer to be used with a variety of theodolites as well. Any of four machined slots in the housing (located at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions) fit over a locating pin on Brunson telescope barrels for quick and accurate indexing of the micrometer to a horizontal or vertical position. A precision glass window acts as a dust cover to protect the optical flat inside. Refer to the table below for descriptions of the various models in this series.</div>

<div>A wide variety of stand adapters, slides, lifts, and various instrument mounts fit into the intermediate tubes of our heavy duty stands. </div>
<p>The 231 Series is also available in a ""hollow"" version, which means that there is an unobstructed vertical path straight down through the center of the stand. This is useful in certain applications when it is critical to position the stand over a specific point. Any stand or accessory designated as ""hollow"" has this characteristic.</p>
<p>A special version of the 231, called the <a href=""/modified-231stk-stand-w-235-3231-mod-0.html""><strong>231-MOD-0</strong></a> (shown in image at right) has a range of <span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>21½"" - 27"" (54.6 - 68.5 cm)</strong></span>. This is shorter than the standard 231, and comes with a <a href=""/stand-adapter-hollow235-3.html"">235-3 instrument adapter</a> on top.</p>
<p>Stands in this group are generally used to support all types of metrology instrumentation, from portable CMM arms to laser trackers and scanners, to laser alignment devices, particularly when working with surface plates, machine tables, way checking, and assembly operations. Stability is the keyword here; this stand maintains instrument position very well, but it is not the type of stand that you throw over your shoulder and carry around! Mobility around the shop floor is permitted using the drop-down casters under the heavy-duty tribrach base which are engaged and released by a foot pedal. An air-check mechanism provides backup protection to prevent sudden drops of the instrument column in case the operator simultaneously releases the collar lock and main handle while disengaging the ratchet pawl.</p>

<div>The <strong>233 Series</strong> metrology stands are virtually identical to the <a href=""/230-series-heavy-duty-stands.html"">230 Series</a>, but are all somewhat shorter. This stand has a working height range from a minimum of <span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>37"" (94 cm)</strong></span> to a maximum of <span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>56.5"" (143.5 cm)</strong></span>, as measured from the floor to the top of the intermediate tube, on which all instrument mount accessories are attached. The stand height specification quoted above does not include the added height and vertical range of any of our stand accessories or instrument adapters.
<p><br />We have a number of <a href=""/products/3d-metrology-products/metrology-stands-amp-accessories/instrument-adapters.html"">stand adapters</a>, slides, lifts, and various instrument mounts that fit into the intermediate tube. </p>
<p>The 233 Series is also available in a ""hollow"" version, which means that there is an unobstructed vertical path straight down through the center of the stand. This is useful in certain applications when it is critical to position the stand over a specific point. Any stand or accessory designated as ""hollow"" has this characteristic.</p>
<p>Stands in this group are used to support all types of metrology instrumentation, from portable CMM arms to laser trackers and scanners, to theodolites, to laser alignment devices. The stand has excellent stability; it maintains instrument position very well, but it is not the type of stand that you throw over your shoulder and carry around! Mobility around the shop floor is permitted using the drop-down casters under the heavy-duty tribrach base which are engaged and released by a foot pedal. An air-check mechanism provides backup protection to prevent sudden drops of the instrument column in case the operator simultaneously releases the collar lock and main handle while disengaging the ratchet pawl.</p>

<p>The <strong>234 Series</strong> of stand extensions increase the effective stand height from 3"" (7.6 cm) to 48"" (122 cm), depending upon model (see table below). Although these tubes are not designed to provide a precision height standard, metric extension tubes are also available as a complement to an all-metric system. Made of your choice of heavy-walled steel or aluminum tubing with a standard 3½""-8 thread on each end (one internal on the bottom to fit the stand, and one external on the top to fit an instrument or adapter). Other lengths and thread specifications are available by special order.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Extension tubes are provided to increase versatility of measurement systems. Excessive stand height build-up using extension tubes is not recommended due to the possibility of decreased stability and accuracy.</p>

<div>The&nbsp;<strong>272-15</strong>&nbsp;is a multiple purpose test collimator, specifically designed for use in collimating test stands and instrument adjustment applications. Use it to test the straightness of the line of sight of your optical instruments or as a general purpose infinity collimator. It has eight filar/bi-filar targets placed at various optically-simulated distances. Each target contains a label identifying its ""distance"" along the optical path. This allows you to test and calculate the deviation of any optical instrument's line of sight from a perfectly straight line. A special objective system assures high target definition and optical clarity. Each target is adjustable and may be centered on the mechanical axis of the collimator if desired. Targets are illuminated using the low-voltage light source (included) for backlighting. The&nbsp;<strong>272-15</strong>&nbsp;may be mounted in any V-block or wye-type base such as our&nbsp;88-6&nbsp;or&nbsp;89.&nbsp; Plastic instrument case included.

<p>Functionally similar to the larger model 2062, the <strong>381</strong>'s compact size results in affordability without compromising accuracy. This instrument comes in two additional variations; the <strong>381-S</strong> is identical other than having a special reticle, and the <strong>381-1</strong> has a right angle eyepiece which swivels to any axial orientation.</p>
<p>The 6.978"" long barrel meets A.I.A. specifications, and is hardened and ground to assure good stability and accuracy. The barrel's outside diameter is 1&frac34;"".</p>
<p>The instrument contains an autoreflection target which is concentric to the line of sight within &plusmn;0.001"". This target has paired-line spacings of 0.012"", 0.036"" and 0.110"" for use at all distances up to 100 feet. (The target pattern also has a centered 0.092"" radius circle target.) The target is illuminated from the rear by an autocollimation light source.</p>
<p>The model 381, 381-S, or 381-1 may be set up using mounting base model 88-6 or ""V"" blocks. Custom mounting hardware is available by request. Includes our 509 light source, offering cool LED lighting to decrease heat distortion.</p>

<div>
<p>Our&nbsp;<strong>406 Series</strong>&nbsp;Bore Targets may be used to establish centerlines of large cylindrical units or bores such as extruder tubes, crankshaft bores, turbine/ generator bores, etc. The compact and flexible design accommodates a wide range of bore diameters.</p>
<p>Two models are available in this series: the model <strong>406-6</strong> accommodates a maximum bore diameter of 60"" (1.52 m), while the <strong>406-6A</strong> can handle a bore up to 150"" (3.8 m) in diameter.</p>
<p>The unit is made for quick and easy field setup. Stability is assured with solid leg connections (rather than telescoping legs) and the use of ""sleds"" as feet - no more targets slipping or falling out of bores during your alignment. This feature makes the 406 Series ideal for half-bore and vertical applications. Leg design helps to minimize sag.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">In use, the target is first positioned roughly in the bore center with adjustable feet, then the central target holder is ""indicated in"". This is achieved using the dial indicator, which is mounted on a sweep arm connected to a rotating central hub. The hub, in turn, contains the optical target. The central hub is adjustable so that it - and therefore the target - may be brought to dead center.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">This process also reveals and quantifies any out-of-round conditions in the bore.</p>
</div>
<div>
<div>When used in half-bore configurations, the horizontal legs are situated just below the bore's centerline (photo at right).</div>
<p>The target holder is sized for any 2&frac14;"" diameter target. The kit includes a 795 multi-shot distance target. The legs terminate in ball feet or sleds, as desired by the user (both are included). The target holder also has unique adjustments for calibration of wire targets.</p>

<div>
<p>Our models <strong>509</strong> (battery powered) and <strong>509-AC</strong> (AC powered) light sources fit our various <a href=""/metrology-3d-measurement-optical-instruments"">instruments and accessories</a> to provide reticle or target illumination for alignment functions. Many of our optical tooling instruments are capable of performing alignment functions such as autoreflection, collimation, autocollimation, colineation, and reticle projection. However, a light source is required to illuminate the reticle in all of these procedures.</p>
<p>Cool source lighting is provided by a white LED lamp which is almost as bright as our old fiberoptic light sources and which has a 100,000 hour life. The light source is powered by three common button cell batteries (included) that provide 100 hours of illumination. The light source casing is made of stainless steel and incorporates a water resistant seal, making it tough enough for your most challenging industrial environments. The twist-on, twist-off feature means there are no switches or wires to break. Its compact size fits easily in your pocket, instrument case or tool box. You can even plunge a transit with a 509 light source installed.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we offer the model 509-AC light source when the freedom and convenience of battery operation is just too much to bear. The 509-AC includes a lightweight multi-input voltage (100-240V) transformer with multiple plug configurations, which allows this unit to operate worldwide.</p>
<p>To use this light source as a target backlight on our <a href=""/spherical-mount521-b.html"">521-B spherical mount</a>, order accessory 509-SMB. To use this light source as a target backlight for Taylor Hobson's 112/376 spherical mount, order accessory 509-SMTH.</p>

<div>These scales are used with our optical instruments to measure the precise distance of any object from the line of sight.  Then, since the line of sight effectively establishes an extremely straight reference line, alignments between different objects (such as machine components, foundations, rollers, etc.) are quantifiable.</div>
<div><br />Our scales have optical targets evenly spaced every 0.100"". The optical micrometer on an instrument works as a vernier, displacing the line of sight laterally. Using this displacement, the reticle is ""brought into register"" with the nearest target on the scale, and the precise displacement is read directly from the graduated micrometer drum. By adding or subtracting the micrometer's reading from the scale position, a precise measurement is made. </div>
<div><br /><a href=""/blog/post/scales-for-metrology"">Visit our knowledgebase</a> to learn more about our scale patterns, features, and targeting characteristics.<br /> </div>

<div>
</div><div id=""copy"">
<p>The Rail Alignment Kit (9106) brings an innovative solution to an old problem: the proper alignment of a headrig primary breakdown line. When coupled with our Sawmill Kit (9105), the Rail Alignment Kit provides fast, accurate alignment of headrig carriage rails, band mill wheels and saws. These kits also guide the alignment of overhead end-dogger and round rail carriage systems.</p>
<p>Misalignment of these components can drastically reduce a log's yield. The Rail Alignment Kit helps restore these machines to proper specifications, simultaneously recovering lost revenue and improving lumber quality.</p>

<div>The <strong>0.5THSC</strong> magnetic adapter is used to gather quick data points over a range of hole sizes using a single adapter. The secret is a spring-loaded, cone-shaped, locating plunger (see illustration below). This adapter will locate on hole sizes 0.100"" to 0.420"" (2.5 mm to 10.5 mm). Keep in mind that we can also make these adapters to fit other hole diameters on request. Three strong magnets on the bottom keep the adapter squarely on any ferrous surface, and counteract the spring-loaded force of the plunger. The adapter is reliable and repeatable. A grooved profile around the outer perimeter assists in removal after measuring is finished. The adapter holds the centerpoint of a 0.5"" diameter SMR 1.000"" (or 25 mm for the metric version) above the surface of the part and on centerline of the hole to a tolerance of ±0.001"" (±0.025 mm). The SMR seats on a conical land and is held in place by a magnet.  </div>

<p>The magnets are provided (one per adapter) but not installed. This is so that you can heat treat the entire fixture after all adapters are welded on (if desired) without affecting the magnetism of the magnets.

<div>The&nbsp;<strong>0.875THSC</strong>&nbsp;magnetic adapter is used to gather quick data points over a range of hole sizes using a single adapter.&nbsp; The secret is a spring-loaded, cone-shaped, locating plunger (see illustration below). This adapter will locate on hole sizes 0.100"" to 0.625"" (2.5 mm to 15.9 mm). Keep in mind that we can also make these adapters to fit other hole diameters on request. Three strong magnets on the bottom keep the adapter squarely on any ferrous surface, and counteract the spring-loaded force of the plunger. The adapter is reliable and repeatable. A knurled profile around the outer perimeter assists in removal after measuring is finished. The adapter holds the centerpoint of a 0.875"" diameter SMR 1.500"" (or 40 mm for the metric version) above the surface of the part and on centerline of the hole to a tolerance of &plusmn;0.0005"" (&plusmn;0.013 mm).

<div>The <strong>1.5THS</strong> magnetic adapter provides an SMR nest which fits into any corner and puts a 1.5"" diameter SMR exactly 0.800"" away from the rising surface, within ±0.0005"". It also holds the centerpoint of the SMR 1.000"" (or 25 mm for the metric version) ±0.0005"" above the base surface. A chamfer on the bottom side of this adapter provides a relief for any fillets or various strange things happening at the junction between the surfaces of the object being measured. The SMR seats on a 3-point conical land. An optical alley allows the SMR to be rotated down further for a lower shooting angle.

<div>The <strong>1.5THSC</strong> magnetic adapter is used to gather quick data points over a range of hole sizes using a single adapter. The secret? A spring-loaded, cone-shaped, locating plunger (illustration below). This adapter will locate on hole sizes 0.100"" to 0.625"" (2.5 mm to 16 mm). Keep in mind that we can also make these adapters to fit other hole diameters on request. Three strong magnets on the bottom keep the adapter squarely on any ferrous surface, and counteract the spring-loaded force of the plunger. The adapter is reliable and repeatable. A knurl around the outer perimeter assists in removal after measuring is finished. The adapter holds the centerpoint of a 1.5"" diameter SMR 2.000"" (or 50 mm for the metric version) above the surface of the part and on centerline of the hole to a tolerance of ±0.001"" (±0.025 mm). The SMR seats on a 3-point conical land and is held in place by a magnet.</div>

<div class=""tabs"">
</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"">
<p>The <strong>1.5THW</strong> magnetic adapter is meant to be welded permanently in place on any customer fixture. A substantial chamfer around the bottom edge makes for a nicer weld. This item is available in a variety of materials, and is <strong>not</strong> hardened like most of our other adapters. Place it on your fixture in any desired location, add a few weld tacks around the perimeter, and you have a permanent SMR reference. Think of it as a non-drifting drift nest.</p>
<p>The adapter holds the centerpoint of a 1.5"" diameter SMR 1"" above the surface of the part, although this dimension is not critically controlled because this adapter is simply meant to establish a permanent reference point. The SMR locates on a three-point conical land.</p>
<p>The magnets are provided (one per adapter) but not installed. This is so that you can heat treat the entire fixture after all adapters are welded on (if desired) without affecting the magnetism of the magnets. When ready, the magnets may be installed in the magnet well. We recommend securing the magnets using an adhesive for extra security. Of course, this is mandatory for 1.5THW products constructed from non-magnetic materials. (Hint: don't do this until you are finished with your processing - sometimes they're very hard to get back out!) See our related 1.5THWB, which is the same item with a button base for locating the adapter.</p>

<div id=""copy"" class=""tab"">
<p>The <strong>230-F Series</strong> stands are a great solution when absolute stability is required, and no vertical height adjustment is needed. Often the perfect choice for tracker, scanner, or portable CMM arm applications, the 230-F Series stands give you performance that is as solid as a rock, and easy on your budget as well. This stand comes in several heights (see table below) and is also available in custom heights as required. Permanently mounted on top of this stand is an adapter with an external 3&frac12;""-8 instrument thread. Note that our 234 Series extension tubes are often used with the 230-F stands when accommodation of various fixed heights is required.</p>
<p>As stated, this stand maintains instrument position extremely well, but is not the type of stand that you throw over your shoulder and carry around. Mobility around the shop floor is permitted using the drop-down casters under the heavy-duty tribrach base which are engaged and released by a foot pedal. The stand rests on three adjustable 5/8""-11 trivet bolts when the casters are retracted.</p>

<div>Sometimes you really need to reach the sky with a stable metrology platform. Our <strong>232-SP Series</strong> stands are made for such occasions. The 232-SP is available in three configurations whose working heights range from a minimum of <span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>10' 2"" (3.1 m)</strong></span> to as high as <strong><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">37' 4"" (11.4 m)</span></strong>, depending upon the model. Stand height is measured from the floor to the top of the intermediate tube, on which all instrument mount accessories are attached. This height specification does not include the added height and range any of our stand accessories or instrument adapters.<br />
<p><br />A wide variety of our stand adapters, slides, lifts, and various instrument mounts fit into the intermediate tube, which is outfitted with the same 2.825""-20 thread as the intermediate tube on our other, shorter stands. Refer to the chart below for the various stock options, or request your own custom variation.</p>
<p>Stands in this group are used to support all types of metrology instrumentation, and customers who use this stand need a great deal of stability in some very high places. For instance, some of our customers use them in high-bay satellite assembly facilities. Mobility around the shop floor is permitted using the casters (once the trivet ""feet"" are manually retracted) under the heavy-duty tribrach base. An air-check mechanism provides backup protection to prevent sudden drops of the instrument column in case the operator simultaneously releases the collar lock and main handle while disengaging the ratchet pawl.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>When customers asked Brunson to engineer a lightweight industrial stand, they turned to one of the strongest structural elements known &euro;&ldquo; a pre-stressed tetrahedron for ultimate stability. Made from aluminum and stainless steel, the TetraLock and the TetraLock Lite include&nbsp;pad feet, a choice of thread adapter, and a duffel style carrying bag. These portable stands can be checked in as luggage or stowed in the trunk, and used on tables or platforms.</p>
<p>Engineered for extreme stability, the lightweight TetraLock stand weighs just over 20 lbs. with a maximum height of 47 inches. Due to&nbsp;the TetraLock's&nbsp;unique design, no joint movement&nbsp;is possible&nbsp;when locked in the open position. The TetraLock Lite featherweight stand weighs in at 16.2 lbs. also with a maximum height of 47 inches. It deploys rapidly by tightening a locking plate under its mounting ring.</p>
<p>Both designs offer the best price/performance ratio in the marketplace.</p>

<div id=""tabs-1"">
<p>The height of the stand is adjusted by releasing quick-action levers and&nbsp;setting each telescoping leg to the desired length. Index marks on the legs provide visual guides when doing this. Each leg is outfitted with a ""pad style"" foot. The&nbsp;TetraLock may be purchased with one of three&nbsp;thread&nbsp;mounts: 3&frac12;""-8, 5/8""-11, or 3/8""-16. A duffel style canvas carrying bag with shoulder strap is also&nbsp;included with the stand.</p>

<div>Our scales have optical targets evenly spaced every 2 mm. The optical micrometer on an instrument works like a vernier, displacing the line of sight laterally. Using this displacement, the reticle is ""brought into register"" with the nearest target on the scale, and the precise displacement is read directly from the graduated micrometer drum. By adding or subtracting the micrometer's reading from the scale position, a precise measurement is made. <br /> </div>

<p>The <strong>BP</strong> Series Bar Points are used in conjunction with our BXT&nbsp;Series&nbsp;extension bars and various SMR holders having 1/4"" or 6mm shafts. This type of assembly (see photo at bottom of page) is often used to locate and specify various points using a sphere-fit routine*. The BP is handy for targeting scribe lines, edges, or other points of interest on surfaces or contours. It is especially useful for measuring points which are obscured from view. Using the BP with its targeting assembly to measure hidden points allows you to avoid making additional tracker moves and subsequent rebundles, thereby saving time and potential error buildup. These adapters make more efficient use of your laser tracker equipment while maintaining the accuracy needed for most tasks.</p>
<p>The BP includes a 6-32 set screw at the bottom of the hole (see sketch below). This is used to secure the BP to our BXT extension bars. Be sure to match the BP unit type with BXT unit type (English or metric).</p>

<p>*A ""sphere fit rod"" assembly (shown right) may be constructed from a BXT extension bar, an SMR adapter, and a BP Bar Point. It is used to measure a number of points which are all a given distance away from one particular point of interest, making that point of interest the center of an arbitrary sphere. Then, a sphere-fit routine is commonly used to calculate that center point. In the picture, the BP is centered on a scribe line.</p>

All shanks are drilled and tapped with a 6-32 internal thread. The shank then mates with the connecting screw on the inside of a TBA or BP tip, again assuming that English and metric tips are matched with English and metric bars, respectively. Both tips are seen in the photo at right. The precision bore on the opposite end will accept SMR nests which have a matching shank diameter (1/4"" or 6 mm), such as 1.5TH-1-.25 or 1.5TH-25MM-6MM. These accessories are held in place with a radially-mounted, nylon-tipped setscrew.</div>

It is used to measure a number of points which are all a given distance away from one particular point of interest, making that point of interest the center of an arbitrary sphere. Then, a sphere-fit routine is commonly used to calculate that center point.</div>

<div>
<p>The <strong>M-Series&nbsp;</strong>metrology stands have been requested both by customers and other metrology instrument OEMs. With their input, Brunson has designed this instrument stand for functionality and portability. This collapsible, tripod-type stand is available in a number of standard configurations. Just tell us your preference.</p>
<p><strong>Graphite or aluminum legs.</strong> These stands are available with aluminum or graphite double upper legs, which span from the shoulder pivots to the ""knee"" of the stand. Stands with graphite upper legs have a lower weight and give an advantage with respect to thermal stability.</p>
<p><strong>Adjustable or fixed instrument mount.</strong> The stand is available with either an adjustable instrument column, also called the ""intermediate tube"" (below left) or with an instrument adapter fixed directly to the tribrach at the top of the stand (below right). The adjustable instrument mount employs a handwheel-driven worm gear for up-and-down adjustment of the instrument column. The collar may then be clamped to avoid any inadvertent instrument movement. An adapter on top of the intermediate tube provides a standard external 3&frac12;""-8 thread for mounting instruments or other adapters. Note that the intermediate tubes on our M-Series portable stands do not have the same internal threads as found on our bigger stands, and as such will not directly accommodate adapters such as the model 800 precision lift.</p>

<p>The ""fixed height"" version of the stand has an adapter mounted directly to the top of the stand. For applications where fine vertical adjustment of the instrument is not necessary, this version reduces cost and increases lateral stability.</p>
<p>Note that the height of either type of stand (fixed or adjustable mount) may be adjusted by extending and locking the lower legs at the desired position.</p>

<div><br /><strong><br />Short or tall.</strong><span> The M-series stands are available in a short or tall version. The double upper leg section and the adjustable instrument column of the tall version are longer, providing the additional height. The lower leg sections are the same length on both versions.</span>
<p><br /><strong>Points or pads.</strong> The stand's lower leg will accommodate two different types of feet - trivet points (image left top) or swivel pad feet (image left bottom). The swivel pads have a thin, textured rubber pad on the bottom. Either type of foot is an acceptable choice for general applications. The points work well on uneven surfaces, the pads work well on smooth surfaces (e.g., finished concrete) to resist sliding and soft surfaces (e.g., linoleum) which the points may damage. Pads have the additional advantage of being outfitted with a hole for semi-permanent mounting. The feet are easily interchangeable in the field. The M-Series comes standard with both trivet point feet and pad feet.</p>

<p>A wide variety of stand adapters, slides, lifts, and various instrument mounts fit into the intermediate tubes of our heavy duty stands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 231 Series is also available in a ""hollow"" version, which means that there is an unobstructed vertical path straight down through the center of the stand. This is useful in certain applications when it is critical to position the stand over a specific point. Any stand or accessory designated as ""hollow"" has this characteristic.</p>

This is shorter than the standard 231, and comes with a 235-3 instrument adapter on top.</p>
<p>Stands in this group are generally used to support all types of metrology instrumentation, from portable CMM arms to laser trackers and scanners, to laser alignment devices, particularly when working with surface plates, machine tables, way checking, and assembly operations. Stability is the keyword here; this stand maintains instrument position very well, but it is not the type of stand that you throw over your shoulder and carry around! Mobility around the shop floor is permitted using the drop-down casters under the heavy-duty tribrach base which are engaged and released by a foot pedal. An air-check mechanism provides backup protection to prevent sudden drops of the instrument column in case the operator simultaneously releases the collar lock and main handle while disengaging the ratchet pawl.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The baseplate is a 1"" (2.54cm) thick steel plate with a diameter of 15"" (38.1cm). Four 1-1/16"" (2.7cm) mounting holes are equally spaced on an 11"" (27.9cm) diameter bolt circle on this baseplate. It is also outfitted with four 5/8""-11 UNC-2B threaded leveling screws on a 14&rdquo; (35.6cm) diameter bolt circle to provide a means for adjustment to set the stand vertical.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Stands in this group are used for permanent installations of all types of metrology instrumentation, and are often used in test, calibration, or constant monitoring applications.</p>

<div class=""tabs"">
</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"">The <strong>190</strong> optical micrometer translates the line of sight laterally with an accuracy of ±0.0005"" using an optical flat. The cast aluminum housing has a 1.655"" opening to fit the telescope barrel of all Brunson optical tooling transits and levels. Adapters are available which allow this micrometer to be used with a variety of theodolites as well.

<div class=""tabs"">
</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"">
<p>Our models <strong>509</strong> (battery powered) and <strong>509-AC</strong> (AC powered) light sources fit our various instruments and accessories to provide reticle or target illumination for alignment functions. Many of our optical tooling instruments are capable of performing alignment functions such as autoreflection, collimation, autocollimation, colineation, and reticle projection. However, a light source is required to illuminate the reticle in all of these procedures.</p>
<p>Cool source lighting is provided by a white LED lamp which is almost as bright as our old fiberoptic light sources and which has a 100,000 hour life. The light source is powered by three common button cell batteries (included) that provide 100 hours of illumination. The light source casing is made of stainless steel and incorporates a water resistant seal, making it tough enough for your most challenging industrial environments. The twist-on, twist-off feature means there are no switches or wires to break. Its compact size fits easily in your pocket, instrument case or tool box. You can even plunge a transit with a 509 light source installed.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we offer the model 509-AC light source when the freedom and convenience of battery operation is just too much to bear. The 509-AC includes a lightweight multi-input voltage (100-240V) transformer with multiple plug configurations, which allows this unit to operate worldwide.</p>
<p>To use this light source as a target backlight on our 521-B spherical mount, order accessory 509-SMB. To use this light source as a target backlight for Taylor Hobson's 112/376 spherical mount, order accessory 509-SMTH.</p>

<div>Our <strong>MVTB Series </strong>motorized vertical tooling bars give you the ability to position your instrument easily to any point within a wide vertical range.<br />
<p style=""margin-top: 1em;"">This stand is designed for use with many types of metrology instruments. The instrument is mounted on a shelf which is attached to a motor-driven carriage. The instrument shelf is outfitted with a 3½""-8 thread and/or a receiver for the Nikon Laser Radar, at your option. At its lowest point, the shelf is about 3.5 feet (1.1 m) above the ground. A ground-level, hand-held pendant controls the movement of the carriage along the vertical rail. A motor brake holds the carriage in place if power is lost.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 1em;"">Casters situated under the heavy-duty tribrach base allow mobility around the shop floor (once the trivet ""feet"" are manually retracted). We recommend a very slow-speed towing vehicle although it is possible for several people to move the tooling bar manually.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 1em;"">The MVTB is a standard product but is made to order. The only information we require is the maximum height that you wish to position your instrument.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 1em;"">These tooling bars have two different height classes - Standard and Extended. Please refer to the table below for height specifications regarding these two classes. Note that assembly of these tooling bars is required on site and is not trivial. Many of our customers are capable of assembling Standard Class tooling bars, but factory technicians may be hired to do so for an additional cost after delivery.</p>

<div class=""tabs"">
</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"">Our <strong>232 Series </strong>stands are great for those special jobs where reaching the heights is required. The 232 is available in a number of configurations, whose working heights range from a minimum of <strong><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">67"" (1.7 m)</span></strong> to as high as <span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>112"" (2.84 m)</strong></span>, depending upon the configuration desired. Stand height is measured from the floor to the top of the intermediate tube, on which all instrument mount accessories are attached. This height specification does not include the added height and range any of our stand accessories or instrument adapters.
<p>A wide variety of our stand adapters, slides, lifts, and various instrument mounts fit into the intermediate tube, which is outfitted with the same 2.825""-20 thread as the intermediate tube on our other, shorter stands. </p>
<p>The 232 Series is also available in a ""hollow"" version, which means that there is an unobstructed vertical path straight down through the center of the stand. This is useful in certain applications when it is critical to position the stand over a specific point. Any stand or accessory designated as ""hollow"" has this characteristic.</p>
<p>Stands in this group are used to support all types of metrology instrumentation, and customers who use this stand need stability in high places. Mobility around the shop floor is permitted using the drop-down casters under the heavy-duty tribrach base which are engaged and released by a handwheel crank mechanism. An air-check mechanism provides backup protection to prevent sudden drops of the instrument column in case the operator simultaneously releases the collar lock and main handle while disengaging the ratchet pawl.</p>
<p>For general information about this stand, you can read more about our heavy duty stands on this website.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: If these stands are not tall enough for you, check out the 232-SP Series stands, or contact us for a custom stand quote. We have built various stands and vertical tooling bars as high as 40 feet.</em></p>

<p>Our <strong>0.5THC-V</strong> (vertical) and <strong>0.5THC-H</strong> (horizontal) SMR retaining clamps gives you another way to protect those valuable SMRs from damage. Put the SMR in the target nest, then slip the retainer over the SMR. Then use the flat-tipped M2 set screws to secure the clamp to the target holder. The 0.5THC-H clamps allow the SMR to rotate horizontally, with a 200&deg; range of motion. The 0.5THC-V clamps allow the SMR to rotate vertically, with a 90&deg; range of motion (allowing the SMR to point straight up). All 0.5THC models fit 0.5"" SMRs, but the diameter of the pin nest must also be considered when choosing the desired model <em>(see table below)</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<div>The <strong>707</strong> paired line target pattern is machine engraved and black filled, on circular white plexiglas. The pattern has two paired lines that do not cross each other (a white cross outlined with black lines in each corner). These targets are translucent and may be backlit for additional visibility in low light applications. Backlighting this target when used as the far target in a line of bore targets gives a great diffuse backlight for the other targets in the line. The 2¼"" (57.2 mm) diameter meets A.I.A. specifications. It may be used in our spherical targeting systems. These targets have holes drilled through on the target's diameter for mounting and to facilitate target removal from tight spots.</div>
<div><br />The 707 is available in a wide variety of target pattern spacings as presented in the table below. The target spacing is engraved at the top of the target (in inch units). We have information to help you choose the proper target line spacing <a href=""/blog/post/metrology-targets"">in the knowledgebase</a>.</div>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>When customers asked Brunson to engineer a lightweight industrial stand, they turned to one of the strongest structural elements known - a pre-stressed tetrahedron for ultimate stability. Made from aluminum and stainless steel, the TetraLock and the TetraLock Lite include pad feet, a choice of thread adapter, and a duffel style carrying bag. These portable stands can be checked in as luggage or stowed in the trunk, and used on tables or platforms.</p>
<p>Engineered for extreme stability, the lightweight TetraLock stand weighs just over 20 lbs. with a maximum height of 47"". Due to the TetraLock's unique design, no joint movement is possible when locked in the open position. The TetraLock Lite featherweight stand weighs in at 16.2 lbs. also with a maximum height of 47"". It deploys rapidly by tightening a locking plate under its mounting ring.</p>
<p>Both designs offer the best price/performance ratio in the marketplace.</p>
<hr style=""size: 1px;"" />
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>The height of the stand is adjusted by releasing quick-action levers and setting each telescoping leg to the desired length. Index marks on the legs provide visual guides when doing this. Each leg is outfitted with a ""pad style"" foot. The TetraLock may be purchased with one of three thread mounts: 3½""-8, 5/8""-11, or 3/8""-16. A duffel style canvas carrying bag with shoulder strap is also included with the stand.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bubble level (on TetraLock only)</li>
<li>Easy transport, fast setup</li>
<li>Cross braces are rotated down and snap into place, secured with knurled, collet-style clamps. This forces the stand into a pre-stressed, pyramid-like shape, locking each leg against a positive stop.</li>
<li>The more economical Tetralock Lite deploys by tightening a locking plate under its mounting ring.</li>
<li>Each stand is collapsible for storage, yet has no movement within its joints when locked in the open position.</li>
</ul>

<div class=""tabs""></div>
<div id=""copy"" class=""tab"">Any of our <strong>230 Series</strong> metrology stands are an excellent choice for average shop and plant requirements. This stand has a working height range from a minimum of <strong><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">43"" (109 cm)</span></strong> to a maximum of <strong><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">68.5"" (174 cm)</span></strong>.
<p>A variety of stand adapters, slides, lifts, and various instrument mounts fit into the intermediate tube.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 230 Series is also available in a ""hollow"" version, which means that there is an unobstructed vertical path straight down through the center of the stand. This is useful in certain applications when it is critical to position the stand over a specific point. Any stand or accessory designated as ""hollow"" has this characteristic.</p>
<p>Stands in this group are used to support all types of metrology instrumentation, from portable CMM arms to laser trackers and scanners, to theodolites, to laser alignment devices. Our customers are always putting something new on this stand, which attests to its popularity and flexibility. Stability is the keyword here; this stand maintains instrument position very well, but it is not the type of stand that you throw over your shoulder and carry around! Mobility around the shop floor is permitted using the drop-down casters under the heavy-duty tribrach base which are engaged and released by a foot pedal. An air-check mechanism provides backup protection to prevent sudden drops of the instrument column in case the operator simultaneously releases the collar lock and main handle while disengaging the ratchet pawl.</p>
<p>For additional general information about this stand, read more about our heavy duty stands on this website.</p>

<p>Any of our <b>230 Series</b> metrology stands are an excellent choice for average shop and plant requirements. This stand has a working height range from a minimum of <b>43"" (109 cm)</b> to a maximum of <b>68.5"" (174 cm)</b>.</p>
<p>A variety of stand adapters, slides, lifts, and various instrument mounts fit into the intermediate tube. </p>
<p>The 230 Series is also available in a ""hollow"" version, which means that there is an unobstructed vertical path straight down through the center of the stand. This is useful in certain applications when it is critical to position the stand over a specific point. Any stand or accessory designated as ""hollow"" has this characteristic.</p>
<p>Stands in this group are used to support all types of metrology instrumentation, from portable CMM arms to laser trackers and scanners, to theodolites, to laser alignment devices. Our customers are always putting something new on this stand, which attests to its popularity and flexibility. Stability is the keyword here; this stand maintains instrument position very well, but it is not the type of stand that you throw over your shoulder and carry around! Mobility around the shop floor is permitted using the drop-down casters under the heavy-duty tribrach base which are engaged and released by a foot pedal. An air-check mechanism provides backup protection to prevent sudden drops of the instrument column in case the operator simultaneously releases the collar lock and main handle while disengaging the ratchet pawl.</p>

<div>The <strong>803-M</strong> and <strong>803-MC Invar Kits&nbsp;</strong>are designed as multipurpose kits. They are often used as scale extension tools - precisely extending the range of standard optical tooling scales for accurate measurement of larger dimensions, or to access previously unreachable points. They are also used with calibration scales such as our 6000-CM (and others) as calibration or scaling artifacts for three dimensional measurement systems.
<p>Invar tubing is great for metrology because it has such a very low coefficient of thermal expansion. which effectively eliminates changes in length due to handling or environmental changes. This is particularly beneficial when measuring a system in its ""hot"" or running state.</p>
<p></p>
</div>
<div><img style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" title=""803-M series metric invar kits"" src=""{{store url=""""}}wp-content/uploads/2013/03/803-M-series.gif"" alt="""" width=""403"" height=""90"" /></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>The 803-M and 803-MC kits both contain exactly the same set of components; the only difference between them is that the Invar tubing is manufactured to different length tolerances. The Invar tubing in the 803-M is manufactured to its stated length within &plusmn;0.008 mm, and the Invar tubing in the 803-MC is manufactured to its stated length within &plusmn;0.003 mm. Our metric&nbsp;Invar&nbsp;tubing covered with a tough polyvinyl layer designed to protect your tubing and to allow for easy cleaning. Our metric tubing is yellow in color (English tubing is red).</p>
<p>In each kit, the Invar tubing components are hand-picked so that the total Invar tube stackup error does not exceed the stated maximum. This means that you can connect all of the tubes found in a given kit together end-to-end, and the stack will maintain the total length within the stackup error. (The table above summarizes this information.)</p>
<p>Individual components may be assembled to produce lengths from 25 mm to 2800 mm, in 125 mm increments. The end of each invar tube allows measuring to the tangents of shafts, and a tooling ball contact point offers the best repeatability on most machine surfaces. The table below specifies all included components. Be sure to have a look at our other Invar System components.</p>

<div>
<p>The <strong>160 Series</strong> coordinate optical micrometer literally adds a another dimension to precision alignment. We mounted two optical flats in an aluminum housing so that their axes of rotation are at 90 degrees &plusmn;15 arcseconds. This allows you to monitor two dimensions simultaneously. Many types of bore analysis jobs typically require this type of dual dimensional control. The 160 will effectively convert any transit or level into an alignment telescope for this type of application. Each micrometer translates the line of sight with an accuracy of &plusmn;0.0005"" (or &plusmn;0.01 mm). The cast aluminum housing has a 1.655"" opening to fit the telescope barrel of all Brunson optical tooling transits and levels. Any of four machined slots in the housing (located at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions) fit over a locating pin on Brunson telescope barrels for quick and accurate indexing of the micrometer. A precision glass window acts as a dust cover to protect the optical flats inside. The 160 is available in both English and metric units (refer to the table below).</p>

<p>Sawmills everywhere are faced with demands for tighter tolerances and increased production on aging machinery. But one common problem is often overlooked in this quest for higher performance: machine alignment. Poorly aligned equipment is a hidden drain on time and money. It is a major contributor to breakdowns, lost production and waste. Now, a simple, fast and affordable in-house solution is available.</p>
<p>Critical sawmill quality measurements of Recovery, Deviation and Wedge are greatly improved through optical alignment. This solution can be applied to all sawmill machine centers, some of which include primary breakdown lines, secondary breakdown lines, head rigs, horizontal re-saws, edgers, trimmers, gang saws and planers. Implementing the system takes no time as millwrights already have the necessary skills. Take your mill maintenance program to the next level with the Sawmill Alignment Kit.</p>

<div>
<p>The <strong>290</strong> variable wedge is an important tool for calibration of optical instruments.&nbsp; Mounted in a stand-alone fixture made of cast bronze, the integrated glass block is rotated by a geared mechanism to produce an angular deviation in any line of sight which is roughly normal to the glass.&nbsp; The ""zero point"" on the graduated scale may be rotated to either a horizontal or vertical position (index marks may be seen in the picture at the 12 o'clock and 3 o'clock positions), allowing either horizontal or vertical measurements to be made without physically relocating the entire unit.</p>
</div>
<p>The 290 is equipped with a control cable that is approximately 30"" (76 cm) long for operator convenience in rotating the glass. The cable is easily inserted and removed from the main unit. For a replacement control cable, order part number 6454-G1.</p>
<p>The bottom of the unit has two tapped holes to aid in mounting (see specifications below for more information). You may wish to see our other optical wedge, the model 390, on this website.</p>

<div>The <strong>803</strong> and <strong>803-C Invar Kits </strong>are designed as multipurpose kits. They are often used as scale extension tools - precisely extending the range of standard optical tooling scales for accurate measurement of larger dimensions, or to access previously unreachable points.

<p>The 803 and 803-C Kits both contain exactly the same set of components; the only difference between them is that the Invar tubing is manufactured to different length tolerances. The Invar tubing in the 803 is manufactured to its stated length within ±0.0003"", and the Invar tubing in the 803-C is manufactured to its stated length within ±0.0001"". In each kit, the Invar tubing components are hand-picked so that the total Invar tube stackup error does not exceed the stated maximum. This means that you can connect all of the tubes found in a given kit together end-to-end, and the stack will maintain the total length within the stackup error. (The table above summarizes this information.)</p>
<p>Individual components may be assembled to produce lengths from 1"" to 112"", in 5"" increments. The end of each invar tube allows measuring to the tangents of shafts, and a tooling ball contact point offers the best repeatability on most machine surfaces. A special concave tip is included for use with tooling ball applications. The table below specifies all included components.</p>

<div><br />A variety of stand adapters, slides, lifts, and various instrument mounts fit into the intermediate tube. The stand has an air cushion damper to prevent the column from ""free falling"" and damaging the instrument in the event that the collar lock, ratchet pawl, and lift handle are released at the same time.</div>
<div><br /> The baseplate is a 1"" (2.54 cm) thick steel plate with a diameter of 15"" (38.1 cm). Four 1-1/16"" (2.7 cm) mounting holes are equally spaced on an 11"" (27.9 cm) diameter bolt circle on this baseplate. It is also outfitted with four 5/8""-11 UNC-2B threaded leveling screws on a 14"" (35.6 cm) diameter bolt circle to provide a means for adjustment to set the stand vertical.</div>

<p>The <strong>1.5ADP-.5</strong> magnetic adapter gives you the ability to simulate a 1.5"" SMR while actually using a 0.5"" SMR.  The adapter is a partial 1.5"" diameter ball, precisely machined to hold the center of a 0.5"" SMR at exactly the same point in space as a 1.5"" SMR.  This allows you to accurately measure the locations of nests and target mounts designed for 1.5"" SMRs.  It also allows you to use measurement routines and macros designed for use with a 1.5"" SMR.</p>
<p>The 1.5ADP-.5 comes in handy if you are switching SMR sizes during one measurement session in order to accommodate various nest sizes on your fixture or tools. Use it to avoid performing an extra home-point calibration on laser trackers when you're already set up to use a 1.5"" SMR. It's also great for use with built-in reference systems designed for 1.5"" SMRs - it gives you the 0.750"" offset that you need, and allows you more freedom to switch back and forth between 1.5"" and .5"" SMR targets. It also gives you more flexibility when using a calibration ball bar which only has adapters for 1.5"" SMRs.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<strong>1.5ADP-RPR</strong>&nbsp;probe adapters give you the ability to measure the location of a 1.5"" SMR nest with a portable CMM measuring system. The adapter is a partial 1.5"" diameter ball, precisely machined to hold the center of a spherical probe tip at exactly the same point in space as the center of the 1.5"" SMR. This allows you to accurately measure the positions of nests and target mounts designed for 1.5"" SMRs.</p>
<p>The 1.5ADP-RPR comes in handy if you are required to use multiple measuring systems on one job, cannot obtain line-of-sight with a laser, or only have access to a portable CMM. The center point of the probe's spherical tip is held precisely 0.75"" or 19.05 mm above the surface of the part being measured. To construct the appropriate part number, substitute the diameter of your probe for ""A"" in the legend shown below. For example, to fit a 3 mm probe, the part number would be 1.5ADP-RPR-3.</p>

<div class=""tabs"">
</div><div class=""tab"" id=""copy"">
<p>The <strong>1.5THW</strong> magnetic adapter is meant to be welded permanently in place on any customer fixture. A substantial chamfer around the bottom edge makes for a nicer weld. This item is available in a variety of materials, and is <strong>not</strong> hardened like most of our other adapters. Place it on your fixture in any desired location, add a few weld tacks around the perimeter, and you have a permanent SMR reference. Think of it as a non-drifting drift nest.</p>
<p>The adapter holds the centerpoint of a 1.5"" diameter SMR 1"" above the surface of the part, although this dimension is not critically controlled because this adapter is simply meant to establish a permanent reference point. The SMR locates on a three-point conical land.</p>
<p>The magnets are provided (one per adapter) but not installed. This is so that you can heat treat the entire fixture after all adapters are welded on (if desired) without affecting the magnetism of the magnets. When ready, the magnets may be installed in the magnet well. We recommend securing the magnets using an adhesive for extra security. Of course, this is mandatory for 1.5THW products constructed from non-magnetic materials. (Hint: don't do this until you are finished with your processing - sometimes they're very hard to get back out!) See our related 1.5THWB, which is the same item with a button base for locating the adapter.</p>
<p>Construct the desired part number using the table below, indicating desired material. Please note that other materials are available upon request.</p>

<div>
<p>The <strong>76-RH190</strong> has precision telescope optics mounted on a solid-cast bronze horizontal axle which combine to produce a well-balanced instrument with feather-touch controls. The 76-RH190 is the undisputed ""workhorse"" of optical alignment, providing tremendous flexibility with substantial time and labor savings.</p>
<p>The versatile Brunson 76-RH190 transit combines the traditional main telescope with a fixed-focus cross telescope mounted in the horizontal axis of the instrument. This second telescope is fixed at infinity focus to make collimation or autocollimation with another instrument or a mirror quick and easy. This capability means that the 76-RH190 can be quickly made perpendicular to an optical reference line. By simply shifting from the main eyepiece to the cross-axis eyepiece, an operator can establish or verify his/her position relative to the basic reference line in seconds. This effectively requires only one technician, where previously two were required.</p>

<p>Patented ball bearing mounts permit accurate sweeping of both horizontal and vertical planes.

The <a href=""/coincidence-level-vial194-tm.html"">194-TM</a> has a 360-degree rotating turret to view the magnified bubble image from any position.</p>
<p><strong>Available with English, metric, or no micrometer.</strong> Measurements from the optical reference line are taken by using an optical micrometer mounted on the main telescope. The 76-RH190 comes standard with a model <a href=""/190-series-optical-micrometers.html"">190 optical micrometer</a>. To order the transit with a metric micrometer, see the <a href=""/transit-square-w-190-mic76-rh190-metric.html"">76-RH190M</a>.

<div>
<p>The <strong>545-160</strong> (or the metric version, <strong>545-160M</strong>) comes standard with a dual axis micrometer, combining many of the capabilities of our alignment telescopes with our precision sight level. The dual axis micrometer allows you to measure deviations from the line of sight in both the horizontal and vertical directions simultaneously. These models provide a means of easily combining two types of measurements - level and straightness - in one instrument. This is beneficial for applications such as bore alignments for drive systems, turbine alignments, gearboxes, extruders, engine bearing lands and laboratory optical paths. The 545-160/545-160M is an effective configuration when large mechanical components must be set level as well as straight.</p>

The two-speed telescope tilting screw has a coarse thread to get you in the ballpark quickly, and a fine thread for those precise adjustments which bring you into perfect level. In addition, a coincidence-type level with 2.5 times magnification optically ""folds"" both ends of the precision level vial's bubble together, enabling you to detect the tiniest deviation from level. One arcsecond of tilt is discernible using this ""coincidence"" vial methodology.</p>
<p>This instrument includes a telescope having adjustments to maintain the line of sight straight throughout a focusing range of two inches to infinity, allowing the instrument to be located in the tightest of setups. This straightness is maintained at &plusmn;0.001"" (0.025 mm) from two inches to 17 feet (50.8 mm to 5.2 m) and one arcsecond from 17 feet to infinity. The main telescope tube has a removable section to facilitate conversion for autocollimation, autoprojection, or installation of a right angle eyepiece. The optical micrometer produces repeatable readings with a resolution of 0.001"" (0.025 mm).</p>
<p><img style=""float: left; margin: 10px;"" title=""Drawing of Reticle Pattern"" src=""{{store url=""""}}wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Reticle2.gif"" width=""111"" height=""105"" />The reticle's filar/bifilar pattern makes for easy use with our optical tooling scales, or during collimation and autocollimation procedures. The horizontal axis pivots directly over the vertical axis, making the change in plane height less than 0.0001"" for tilts up to 5 arc minutes either above or below horizontal. This important feature eliminates the need to perform the time-consuming precision plumbing procedure for leveling projects. All 545 models use high quality base components and leveling vials similar in design to our model 76-RH transit, allowing this instrument to sweep precise planes. For rough leveling, the unit has a circular level vial mounted on the base.</p>
<p>Our extreme attention to engineering details means that you can take measurements with accuracies that are difficult to achieve by conventional mechanical methods. Read more about our levels for additional specific information on their many features and uses.</p>
<p><strong>Available with no micrometer if desired.&nbsp;</strong>To order the 545 instrument without any micrometer, use model number 545-1. You may wish to do this, for example, if you already own one of our 190, 190M, 160, or 160M optical micrometers.</p>

<p>All configurations of this instrument include a telescope having adjustments to maintain the line of sight straight throughout a focusing range of two inches to infinity, allowing the instrument to be located in the tightest of setups. This straightness is maintained at &plusmn;0.001"" (0.025 mm) from two inches to 17 feet (50.8 mm to 5.2 m) and one arcsecond from 17 feet to infinity. The main telescope tube has a removable section to facilitate conversion for autocollimation, autoprojection, or installation of a right angle eyepiece. The optical micrometer produces repeatable readings with a resolution of 0.001"" (0.025 mm).</p>
<p><img style=""float: left; margin: 10px;"" title=""Drawing of Reticle Pattern"" src=""{{store url=""""}}wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Reticle2.gif"" width=""111"" height=""105"" />The reticle's filar/bifilar pattern makes for easy use with our optical tooling scales, or during collimation and autocollimation procedures. The horizontal axis pivots directly over the vertical axis, making the change in plane height less than 0.0001"" for tilts up to 5 arc minutes either above or below horizontal. This important feature eliminates the need to perform the time-consuming precision plumbing procedure for leveling projects. All 545 models use high quality base components and leveling vials similar in design to our model 76-RH transit, allowing this instrument to sweep precise planes. For rough leveling, the unit has a circular level vial mounted on the base.</p>
<p>Our extreme attention to engineering details means that you can take measurements with accuracies that are difficult to achieve by conventional mechanical methods. Read more about our levels for additional specific information on their many features and uses.</p>
<p><strong>Available with no micrometer if desired.&nbsp;</strong>To order the 545 instrument without any micrometer, use model number 545-1. You may wish to do this, for example, if you already own one of our 190, 190M, 160, or 160M optical micrometers.</p>

<div>The <strong>771-H190</strong> is our most basic transit. It is great for establishing vertical and horizontal reference planes as well as straight lines. Its name derives from its original use in the building and certification of jigs and fixtures used in aircraft construction. Like our other transits, the line of sight is maintained mutually orthogonal, as well as coincident, with the horizontal and vertical axes. This yields extremely precise, short to medium range alignment capabilities. It has precision telescope optics mounted on a solid-cast bronze horizontal axle which combine to produce a well-balanced instrument with feather-touch controls. The 771-H190 is perfect when you need to establish straight lines and flat planes on many different types of mechanical systems.</div>
<div><br />Patented ball bearing mounts permit accurate sweeping of both horizontal and vertical planes. The 771-H190 employs a 194-TM coincidence level for precision leveling. The 194-TM has a 360-degree rotating turret to view the magnified bubble image from any position.</div>
<div><br />The 771-H190 also has a hollow vertical axis that allows you to look straight down through the instrument base to see targets or collimators which are directly below the instrument.&nbsp;<br /><strong></strong></div>
<div><br /><strong>Available with English, metric, or no micrometer.</strong> Measurements from the optical reference line (the line of sight) are taken by using an optical micrometer mounted on the telescope. The 771-H may be ordered with an English-unit micrometer, a metric-unit micrometer, or no micrometer (see table below).</div>

<p>Sawmills everywhere are faced with demands for tighter tolerances and increased production on aging machinery. But one common problem is often overlooked in this quest for higher performance: machine alignment. Poorly aligned equipment is a hidden drain on time and money. It is a major contributor to breakdowns, lost production and waste. Now, a simple, fast and affordable in-house solution is available.</p>
<p>Critical sawmill quality measurements of Recovery, Deviation and Wedge are greatly improved through optical alignment. This solution can be applied to all sawmill machine centers, some of which include primary breakdown lines, secondary breakdown lines, head rigs, horizontal re-saws, edgers, trimmers, gang saws and planers. Implementing the system takes no time as millwrights already have the necessary skills. Take your mill maintenance program to the next level with the Sawmill Alignment Kit.</p>

<div>
<p>The <strong>545-160M</strong> (or the english version, <strong>545-160</strong>) comes standard with a dual axis micrometer, combining many of the capabilities of our alignment telescopes with our precision sight level. The dual axis micrometer allows you to measure deviations from the line of sight in both the horizontal and vertical directions simultaneously. These models provide a means of easily combining two types of measurements - level and straightness - in one instrument. This is beneficial for applications such as bore alignments for drive systems, turbine alignments, gearboxes, extruders, engine bearing lands and laboratory optical paths. The 545-160/545-160M is an effective configuration when large mechanical components must be set level as well as straight.</p>

The two-speed telescope tilting screw has a coarse thread to get you in the ballpark quickly, and a fine thread for those precise adjustments which bring you into perfect level.

This important feature eliminates the need to perform the time-consuming precision plumbing procedure for leveling projects.

<p>The <strong>76-RH190M</strong> has precision telescope optics mounted on a solid-cast bronze horizontal axle which combine to produce a well-balanced instrument with feather-touch controls. The 76-RH190M is the undisputed ""workhorse"" of optical alignment, providing tremendous flexibility with substantial time and labor savings.</p>
<p>The versatile Brunson 76-RH190M transit combines the traditional main telescope with a fixed-focus cross telescope mounted in the horizontal axis of the instrument. This second telescope is fixed at infinity focus to make collimation or autocollimation with another instrument or a mirror quick and easy. This capability means that the 76-RH190M can be quickly made perpendicular to an optical reference line. By simply shifting from the main eyepiece to the cross-axis eyepiece, an operator can establish or verify his/her position relative to the basic reference line in seconds. This effectively requires only one technician, where previously two were required.</p>

<div>
<div>
<p>The <strong>708</strong> paired line target is circular white plexiglas, with two paired lines that do not cross each other (a white cross outlined with black lines in each corner). These targets are translucent and may be backlit for additional visibility in low-light applications. Backlighting this target when used as the far target in a line of bore targets gives a great diffuse backlight for the other targets in the line. They are extremely similar to our <a href=""/707-series-paired-line-targets.html"">707 series</a>, except that the 708 has a diameter of 1½"" (38.1 mm). These targets have holes drilled through on the target's diameter for mounting and to facilitate target removal from tight spots.</p>
<p>The 708 is available in a variety of target pattern spacings as presented in the chart below. The line spacing is engraved at the top of the target (in inch units). We have information to help you choose the proper target line spacing <a href=""/blog/post/metrology-targets"">in the knowledgebase</a>. We also have other similar targets <a href=""/products/optical-tooling-products/targets-target-holders-amp-mirrors/plastic-amp-aluminum.html"">here</a>.</p>

<div>The <strong>395</strong> see-through target is great for alignment jobs where it is necessary to focus on various collinear targets that are positioned down a single line of sight. Wire targets such as this one prevent any refraction error because glass is not employed to create the target pattern. Instead, pairs of flat stainless steel wires* are fixed in a cross pattern, and mounted in a 2¼"" diameter, heat treated steel ring. Various wire spacings are available (see table below). This target meets A.I.A. specifications.</div>
<div><br />The target centering specification is 0.0005"" (395-5 and 395-10); 0.001"" on all others. The diameter of the steel ring is 2.2498"" to 2.2493"".</div>

<p>AIM retroreflective target tape products are made with 3M 0.005"" thick retroreflective material, which has been used in the metrology industry for years. It is custom coated with a strong <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">non-staining</span> acrylic adhesive to allow for clean removal from most surfaces.</p>
<p>The retroreflective target tape has a top coating of matte finished polyester, extending over the retroreflective with the same custom adhesive, allowing it to be cleanly removed from most surfaces even after weeks. This means no pre-masking or post process cleanup is required.</p>
<p>AIM retroreflective target tape has a total thickness of 0.065"" and works well on straight, as well as contoured surfaces.</p>

<div>The <strong>1.5THSC</strong> magnetic adapter is used to gather quick data points over a range of hole sizes using a single adapter. The secret? A spring-loaded, cone-shaped, locating plunger (illustration below). This adapter will locate on hole sizes 0.100"" to 0.625"" (2.5 mm to 16 mm). Keep in mind that we can also make these adapters to fit other hole diameters on request. Three strong magnets on the bottom keep the adapter squarely on any ferrous surface, and counteract the spring-loaded force of the plunger. The adapter is reliable and repeatable. A knurl around the outer perimeter assists in removal after measuring is finished. The adapter holds the centerpoint of a 1.5"" diameter SMR 2.000"" (or 50 mm for the metric version) above the surface of the part and on centerline of the hole to a tolerance of ±0.001"" (±0.025 mm). The SMR seats on a 3-point conical land and is held in place by a magnet.</div>

<div><br /><strong>KinAiry</strong> is the comprehensive, independent solution for laser tracker evaluation, utilizing NIST's new Interim Field Test Procedure IR-8016<sup>1</sup>. The KinAiry system provides a set of traceable measurements designed to verify volumetric performance in your environment. The result is a colorized graphical analysis that quickly shows the overall health of your tracker - regardless of make or model.
<div><br />
<h4>Comprehensive testing</h4>
<p>Traditional laser tracker field checks often consist of 2-face (front sight/back sight) tests or short reference bar measurements. While these have value, they don't exercise the tracker sufficiently to evaluate performance over a larger working volume. That's why NIST designed a volumetric test to assess the total health of a tracker in the field. A number of measurements are taken on a 2.3 meter bar in various orientations, strategically located to fully exercise both the ranging and angular measurement components of a tracker. The test is quick and easy to run, occupies a small footprint, and provides the ultimate confidence in laser tracker performance - right on the job.</p>
<h4>In your environment</h4>
<p>While there is no substitute for the periodic testing a laser tracker receives at the manufacturer's facility, it is equally important to be confident that the tracker survived the ride home and is operating within spec on the production floor. The role of interim field testing is to evaluate instrument performance and identify errors in conditions of actual use. It answers the question, ""How is my tracker performing right now?"" Results from interim field testing can be used as a required check in the quality audit trail, to confirm instrument performance prior to critical measurements, and to track instrument performance over time.</p>
<h4>Objective, traceable results</h4>
<p>Many companies own laser trackers from different manufacturers, all of which have built-in, firmware-specific field checks requiring operators to be fluent in various test methodologies. KinAiry consolidates these device-specific processes into one system check for any laser tracker. The operator follows a simple script to capture test points using the metrology software of choice along with KinAiry's calibrated 2.3 meter artifact in multiple positions. The data is transferred to KinAiry, where it is analyzed and presented in a colorized graphical plot comparing the tracker's actual performance against the manufacturer's Maximum Permissible Error (MPE). Now there's one field test which objectively qualifies the performance of any tracker using a NIST traceable process. Industry has waited a long time for this! <a href=""https://patents.google.com/patent/US9575163"" target=""_blank"">U.S. Pat. No. 9,575,163</a></p>
